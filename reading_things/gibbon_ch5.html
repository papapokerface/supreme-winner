<p>
  The power of the sword is more sensibly felt in an extensive monarchy,
  than in a small community. It has been calculated by the ablest
  politicians, that no state, without being soon exhausted, can maintain
  above the hundredth part of its members in arms and idleness. But although
  this relative proportion may be uniform, the influence of the army over
  the rest of the society will vary according to the degree of its positive
  strength. The advantages of military science and discipline cannot be
  exerted, unless a proper number of soldiers are united into one body, and
  actuated by one soul. With a handful of men, such a union would be
  ineffectual; with an unwieldy host, it would be impracticable; and the
  powers of the machine would be alike destroyed by the extreme minuteness
  or the excessive weight of its springs. To illustrate this observation, we
  need only reflect, that there is no superiority of natural strength,
  artificial weapons, or acquired skill, which could enable one man to keep
  in constant subjection one hundred of his fellow-creatures: the tyrant of
  a single town, or a small district, would soon discover that a hundred
  armed followers were a weak defence against ten thousand peasants or
  citizens; but a hundred thousand well-disciplined soldiers will command,
  with despotic sway, ten millions of subjects; and a body of ten or fifteen
  thousand guards will strike terror into the most numerous populace that
  ever crowded the streets of an immense capital.
</p>
<p>
  The Prætorian bands, whose licentious fury was the first symptom and
  cause of the decline of the Roman empire, scarcely amounted to the
  last-mentioned number.* They derived their institution from Augustus. That
  crafty tyrant, sensible that laws might color, but that arms alone could
  maintain, his usurped dominion, had gradually formed this powerful body of
  guards, in constant readiness to protect his person, to awe the senate,
  and either to prevent or to crush the first motions of rebellion. He
  distinguished these favored troops by a double pay and superior
  privileges; but, as their formidable aspect would at once have alarmed and
  irritated the Roman people, three cohorts only were stationed in the
  capital, whilst the remainder was dispersed in the adjacent towns of
  Italy. But after fifty years of peace and servitude, Tiberius ventured on
  a decisive measure, which forever rivetted the fetters of his country.
  Under the fair pretences of relieving Italy from the heavy burden of
  military quarters, and of introducing a stricter discipline among the
  guards, he assembled them at Rome, in a permanent camp, which was
  fortified with skilful care, and placed on a commanding situation.
</p>
<p>
  Such formidable servants are always necessary, but often fatal to the
  throne of despotism. By thus introducing the Prætorian guards as it
  were into the palace and the senate, the emperors taught them to perceive
  their own strength, and the weakness of the civil government; to view the
  vices of their masters with familiar contempt, and to lay aside that
  reverential awe, which distance only, and mystery, can preserve towards an
  imaginary power. In the luxurious idleness of an opulent city, their pride
  was nourished by the sense of their irresistible weight; nor was it
  possible to conceal from them, that the person of the sovereign, the
  authority of the senate, the public treasure, and the seat of empire, were
  all in their hands. To divert the Prætorian bands from these
  dangerous reflections, the firmest and best established princes were
  obliged to mix blandishments with commands, rewards with punishments, to
  flatter their pride, indulge their pleasures, connive at their
  irregularities, and to purchase their precarious faith by a liberal
  donative; which, since the elevation of Claudius, was enacted as a legal
  claim, on the accession of every new emperor.
</p>
<p>
  The advocate of the guards endeavored to justify by arguments the power
  which they asserted by arms; and to maintain that, according to the purest
  principles of the constitution, <i>their</i> consent was essentially
  necessary in the appointment of an emperor. The election of consuls, of
  generals, and of magistrates, however it had been recently usurped by the
  senate, was the ancient and undoubted right of the Roman people. But where
  was the Roman people to be found? Not surely amongst the mixed multitude
  of slaves and strangers that filled the streets of Rome; a servile
  populace, as devoid of spirit as destitute of property. The defenders of
  the state, selected from the flower of the Italian youth, and trained in
  the exercise of arms and virtue, were the genuine representatives of the
  people, and the best entitled to elect the military chief of the republic.
  These assertions, however defective in reason, became unanswerable when
  the fierce Prætorians increased their weight, by throwing, like the
  barbarian conqueror of Rome, their swords into the scale.
</p>
<p>
  The Prætorians had violated the sanctity of the throne by the
  atrocious murder of Pertinax; they dishonored the majesty of it by their
  subsequent conduct. The camp was without a leader, for even the præfect
  Lætus, who had excited the tempest, prudently declined the public
  indignation. Amidst the wild disorder, Sulpicianus, the emperor’s
  father-in-law, and governor of the city, who had been sent to the camp on
  the first alarm of mutiny, was endeavoring to calm the fury of the
  multitude, when he was silenced by the clamorous return of the murderers,
  bearing on a lance the head of Pertinax. Though history has accustomed us
  to observe every principle and every passion yielding to the imperious
  dictates of ambition, it is scarcely credible that, in these moments of
  horror, Sulpicianus should have aspired to ascend a throne polluted with
  the recent blood of so near a relation and so excellent a prince. He had
  already begun to use the only effectual argument, and to treat for the
  Imperial dignity; but the more prudent of the Prætorians,
  apprehensive that, in this private contract, they should not obtain a just
  price for so valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ramparts; and, with a
  loud voice, proclaimed that the Roman world was to be disposed of to the
  best bidder by public auction.
</p>
<p>
  This infamous offer, the most insolent excess of military license,
  diffused a universal grief, shame, and indignation throughout the city. It
  reached at length the ears of Didius Julianus, a wealthy senator, who,
  regardless of the public calamities, was indulging himself in the luxury
  of the table. His wife and his daughter, his freedmen and his parasites,
  easily convinced him that he deserved the throne, and earnestly conjured
  him to embrace so fortunate an opportunity. The vain old man hastened to
  the Prætorian camp, where Sulpicianus was still in treaty with the
  guards, and began to bid against him from the foot of the rampart. The
  unworthy negotiation was transacted by faithful emissaries, who passed
  alternately from one candidate to the other, and acquainted each of them
  with the offers of his rival. Sulpicianus had already promised a donative
  of five thousand drachms (above one hundred and sixty pounds) to each
  soldier; when Julian, eager for the prize, rose at once to the sum of six
  thousand two hundred and fifty drachms, or upwards of two hundred pounds
  sterling. The gates of the camp were instantly thrown open to the
  purchaser; he was declared emperor, and received an oath of allegiance
  from the soldiers, who retained humanity enough to stipulate that he
  should pardon and forget the competition of Sulpicianus. *
</p>
<p>
  It was now incumbent on the Prætorians to fulfil the conditions of
  the sale. They placed their new sovereign, whom they served and despised,
  in the centre of their ranks, surrounded him on every side with their
  shields, and conducted him in close order of battle through the deserted
  streets of the city. The senate was commanded to assemble; and those who
  had been the distinguished friends of Pertinax, or the personal enemies of
  Julian, found it necessary to affect a more than common share of
  satisfaction at this happy revolution. After Julian had filled the senate
  house with armed soldiers, he expatiated on the freedom of his election,
  his own eminent virtues, and his full assurance of the affections of the
  senate. The obsequious assembly congratulated their own and the public
  felicity; engaged their allegiance, and conferred on him all the several
  branches of the Imperial power. From the senate Julian was conducted, by
  the same military procession, to take possession of the palace. The first
  objects that struck his eyes, were the abandoned trunk of Pertinax, and
  the frugal entertainment prepared for his supper. The one he viewed with
  indifference, the other with contempt. A magnificent feast was prepared by
  his order, and he amused himself, till a very late hour, with dice, and
  the performances of Pylades, a celebrated dancer. Yet it was observed,
  that after the crowd of flatterers dispersed, and left him to darkness,
  solitude, and terrible reflection, he passed a sleepless night; revolving
  most probably in his mind his own rash folly, the fate of his virtuous
  predecessor, and the doubtful and dangerous tenure of an empire which had
  not been acquired by merit, but purchased by money.
</p>
<p>
  He had reason to tremble. On the throne of the world he found himself
  without a friend, and even without an adherent. The guards themselves were
  ashamed of the prince whom their avarice had persuaded them to accept; nor
  was there a citizen who did not consider his elevation with horror, as the
  last insult on the Roman name. The nobility, whose conspicuous station,
  and ample possessions, exacted the strictest caution, dissembled their
  sentiments, and met the affected civility of the emperor with smiles of
  complacency and professions of duty. But the people, secure in their
  numbers and obscurity, gave a free vent to their passions. The streets and
  public places of Rome resounded with clamors and imprecations. The enraged
  multitude affronted the person of Julian, rejected his liberality, and,
  conscious of the impotence of their own resentment, they called aloud on
  the legions of the frontiers to assert the violated majesty of the Roman
  empire.
</p>
<p>
  The public discontent was soon diffused from the centre to the frontiers
  of the empire. The armies of Britain, of Syria, and of Illyricum, lamented
  the death of Pertinax, in whose company, or under whose command, they had
  so often fought and conquered. They received with surprise, with
  indignation, and perhaps with envy, the extraordinary intelligence, that
  the Prætorians had disposed of the empire by public auction; and
  they sternly refused to ratify the ignominious bargain. Their immediate
  and unanimous revolt was fatal to Julian, but it was fatal at the same
  time to the public peace, as the generals of the respective armies,
  Clodius Albinus, Pescennius Niger, and Septimius Severus, were still more
  anxious to succeed than to revenge the murdered Pertinax. Their forces
  were exactly balanced. Each of them was at the head of three legions, with
  a numerous train of auxiliaries; and however different in their
  characters, they were all soldiers of experience and capacity.
</p>
<p>
  Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain, surpassed both his competitors in
  the nobility of his extraction, which he derived from some of the most
  illustrious names of the old republic. But the branch from which he
  claimed his descent was sunk into mean circumstances, and transplanted
  into a remote province. It is difficult to form a just idea of his true
  character. Under the philosophic cloak of austerity, he stands accused of
  concealing most of the vices which degrade human nature. But his accusers
  are those venal writers who adored the fortune of Severus, and trampled on
  the ashes of an unsuccessful rival. Virtue, or the appearances of virtue,
  recommended Albinus to the confidence and good opinion of Marcus; and his
  preserving with the son the same interest which he had acquired with the
  father, is a proof at least that he was possessed of a very flexible
  disposition. The favor of a tyrant does not always suppose a want of merit
  in the object of it; he may, without intending it, reward a man of worth
  and ability, or he may find such a man useful to his own service. It does
  not appear that Albinus served the son of Marcus, either as the minister
  of his cruelties, or even as the associate of his pleasures. He was
  employed in a distant honorable command, when he received a confidential
  letter from the emperor, acquainting him of the treasonable designs of
  some discontented generals, and authorizing him to declare himself the
  guardian and successor of the throne, by assuming the title and ensigns of
  Cæsar. The governor of Britain wisely declined the dangerous honor,
  which would have marked him for the jealousy, or involved him in the
  approaching ruin, of Commodus. He courted power by nobler, or, at least,
  by more specious arts. On a premature report of the death of the emperor,
  he assembled his troops; and, in an eloquent discourse, deplored the
  inevitable mischiefs of despotism, described the happiness and glory which
  their ancestors had enjoyed under the consular government, and declared
  his firm resolution to reinstate the senate and people in their legal
  authority. This popular harangue was answered by the loud acclamations of
  the British legions, and received at Rome with a secret murmur of
  applause. Safe in the possession of his little world, and in the command
  of an army less distinguished indeed for discipline than for numbers and
  valor, Albinus braved the menaces of Commodus, maintained towards Pertinax
  a stately ambiguous reserve, and instantly declared against the usurpation
  of Julian. The convulsions of the capital added new weight to his
  sentiments, or rather to his professions of patriotism. A regard to
  decency induced him to decline the lofty titles of Augustus and Emperor;
  and he imitated perhaps the example of Galba, who, on a similar occasion,
  had styled himself the Lieutenant of the senate and people.
</p>
<p>
  Personal merit alone had raised Pescennius Niger, from an obscure birth
  and station, to the government of Syria; a lucrative and important
  command, which in times of civil confusion gave him a near prospect of the
  throne. Yet his parts seem to have been better suited to the second than
  to the first rank; he was an unequal rival, though he might have approved
  himself an excellent lieutenant, to Severus, who afterwards displayed the
  greatness of his mind by adopting several useful institutions from a
  vanquished enemy. In his government Niger acquired the esteem of the
  soldiers and the love of the provincials. His rigid discipline fortified
  the valor and confirmed the obedience of the former, whilst the voluptuous
  Syrians were less delighted with the mild firmness of his administration,
  than with the affability of his manners, and the apparent pleasure with
  which he attended their frequent and pompous festivals. As soon as the
  intelligence of the atrocious murder of Pertinax had reached Antioch, the
  wishes of Asia invited Niger to assume the Imperial purple and revenge his
  death. The legions of the eastern frontier embraced his cause; the opulent
  but unarmed provinces, from the frontiers of Æthiopia to the
  Hadriatic, cheerfully submitted to his power; and the kings beyond the
  Tigris and the Euphrates congratulated his election, and offered him their
  homage and services. The mind of Niger was not capable of receiving this
  sudden tide of fortune: he flattered himself that his accession would be
  undisturbed by competition and unstained by civil blood; and whilst he
  enjoyed the vain pomp of triumph, he neglected to secure the means of
  victory. Instead of entering into an effectual negotiation with the
  powerful armies of the West, whose resolution might decide, or at least
  must balance, the mighty contest; instead of advancing without delay
  towards Rome and Italy, where his presence was impatiently expected, Niger
  trifled away in the luxury of Antioch those irretrievable moments which
  were diligently improved by the decisive activity of Severus.
</p>
<p>
  The country of Pannonia and Dalmatia, which occupied the space between the
  Danube and the Hadriatic, was one of the last and most difficult conquests
  of the Romans. In the defence of national freedom, two hundred thousand of
  these barbarians had once appeared in the field, alarmed the declining age
  of Augustus, and exercised the vigilant prudence of Tiberius at the head
  of the collected force of the empire. The Pannonians yielded at length to
  the arms and institutions of Rome. Their recent subjection, however, the
  neighborhood, and even the mixture, of the unconquered tribes, and perhaps
  the climate, adapted, as it has been observed, to the production of great
  bodies and slow minds, all contributed to preserve some remains of their
  original ferocity, and under the tame and uniform countenance of Roman
  provincials, the hardy features of the natives were still to be discerned.
  Their warlike youth afforded an inexhaustible supply of recruits to the
  legions stationed on the banks of the Danube, and which, from a perpetual
  warfare against the Germans and Sarmazans, were deservedly esteemed the
  best troops in the service.
</p>
<p>
  The Pannonian army was at this time commanded by Septimius Severus, a
  native of Africa, who, in the gradual ascent of private honors, had
  concealed his daring ambition, which was never diverted from its steady
  course by the allurements of pleasure, the apprehension of danger, or the
  feelings of humanity. On the first news of the murder of Pertinax, he
  assembled his troops, painted in the most lively colors the crime, the
  insolence, and the weakness of the Prætorian guards, and animated
  the legions to arms and to revenge. He concluded (and the peroration was
  thought extremely eloquent) with promising every soldier about four
  hundred pounds; an honorable donative, double in value to the infamous
  bribe with which Julian had purchased the empire. The acclamations of the
  army immediately saluted Severus with the names of Augustus, Pertinax, and
  Emperor; and he thus attained the lofty station to which he was invited,
  by conscious merit and a long train of dreams and omens, the fruitful
  offsprings either of his superstition or policy.
</p>
<p>
  The new candidate for empire saw and improved the peculiar advantage of
  his situation. His province extended to the Julian Alps, which gave an
  easy access into Italy; and he remembered the saying of Augustus, that a
  Pannonian army might in ten days appear in sight of Rome. By a celerity
  proportioned to the greatness of the occasion, he might reasonably hope to
  revenge Pertinax, punish Julian, and receive the homage of the senate and
  people, as their lawful emperor, before his competitors, separated from
  Italy by an immense tract of sea and land, were apprised of his success,
  or even of his election. During the whole expedition, he scarcely allowed
  himself any moments for sleep or food; marching on foot, and in complete
  armor, at the head of his columns, he insinuated himself into the
  confidence and affection of his troops, pressed their diligence, revived
  their spirits, animated their hopes, and was well satisfied to share the
  hardships of the meanest soldier, whilst he kept in view the infinite
  superiority of his reward.
</p>
<p>
  The wretched Julian had expected, and thought himself prepared, to dispute
  the empire with the governor of Syria; but in the invincible and rapid
  approach of the Pannonian legions, he saw his inevitable ruin. The hasty
  arrival of every messenger increased his just apprehensions. He was
  successively informed, that Severus had passed the Alps; that the Italian
  cities, unwilling or unable to oppose his progress, had received him with
  the warmest professions of joy and duty; that the important place of
  Ravenna had surrendered without resistance, and that the Hadriatic fleet
  was in the hands of the conqueror. The enemy was now within two hundred
  and fifty miles of Rome; and every moment diminished the narrow span of
  life and empire allotted to Julian.
</p>
<p>
  He attempted, however, to prevent, or at least to protract, his ruin. He
  implored the venal faith of the Prætorians, filled the city with
  unavailing preparations for war, drew lines round the suburbs, and even
  strengthened the fortifications of the palace; as if those last
  intrenchments could be defended, without hope of relief, against a
  victorious invader. Fear and shame prevented the guards from deserting his
  standard; but they trembled at the name of the Pannonian legions,
  commanded by an experienced general, and accustomed to vanquish the
  barbarians on the frozen Danube. They quitted, with a sigh, the pleasures
  of the baths and theatres, to put on arms, whose use they had almost
  forgotten, and beneath the weight of which they were oppressed. The
  unpractised elephants, whose uncouth appearance, it was hoped, would
  strike terror into the army of the north, threw their unskilful riders;
  and the awkward evolutions of the marines, drawn from the fleet of
  Misenum, were an object of ridicule to the populace; whilst the senate
  enjoyed, with secret pleasure, the distress and weakness of the usurper.
</p>
<p>
  Every motion of Julian betrayed his trembling perplexity. He insisted that
  Severus should be declared a public enemy by the senate. He entreated that
  the Pannonian general might be associated to the empire. He sent public
  ambassadors of consular rank to negotiate with his rival; he despatched
  private assassins to take away his life. He designed that the Vestal
  virgins, and all the colleges of priests, in their sacerdotal habits, and
  bearing before them the sacred pledges of the Roman religion, should
  advance in solemn procession to meet the Pannonian legions; and, at the
  same time, he vainly tried to interrogate, or to appease, the fates, by
  magic ceremonies and unlawful sacrifices.
</p>
<p id="p5.2.1">
  Severus, who dreaded neither his arms nor his enchantments, guarded
  himself from the only danger of secret conspiracy, by the faithful
  attendance of six hundred chosen men, who never quitted his person or
  their cuirasses, either by night or by day, during the whole march.
  Advancing with a steady and rapid course, he passed, without difficulty,
  the defiles of the Apennine, received into his party the troops and
  ambassadors sent to retard his progress, and made a short halt at
  Interamnia, about seventy miles from Rome. His victory was already secure,
  but the despair of the Prætorians might have rendered it bloody; and
  Severus had the laudable ambition of ascending the throne without drawing
  the sword. His emissaries, dispersed in the capital, assured the guards,
  that provided they would abandon their worthless prince, and the
  perpetrators of the murder of Pertinax, to the justice of the conqueror,
  he would no longer consider that melancholy event as the act of the whole
  body. The faithless Prætorians, whose resistance was supported only
  by sullen obstinacy, gladly complied with the easy conditions, seized the
  greatest part of the assassins, and signified to the senate, that they no
  longer defended the cause of Julian. That assembly, convoked by the
  consul, unanimously acknowledged Severus as lawful emperor, decreed divine
  honors to Pertinax, and pronounced a sentence of deposition and death
  against his unfortunate successor. Julian was conducted into a private
  apartment of the baths of the palace, and beheaded as a common criminal,
  after having purchased, with an immense treasure, an anxious and
  precarious reign of only sixty-six days. The almost incredible expedition
  of Severus, who, in so short a space of time, conducted a numerous army
  from the banks of the Danube to those of the Tyber, proves at once the
  plenty of provisions produced by agriculture and commerce, the goodness of
  the roads, the discipline of the legions, and the indolent, subdued temper
  of the provinces.
</p>
<p>
  The first cares of Severus were bestowed on two measures, the one dictated
  by policy, the other by decency; the revenge, and the honors, due to the
  memory of Pertinax. Before the new emperor entered Rome, he issued his
  commands to the Prætorian guards, directing them to wait his arrival
  on a large plain near the city, without arms, but in the habits of
  ceremony, in which they were accustomed to attend their sovereign. He was
  obeyed by those haughty troops, whose contrition was the effect of their
  just terrors. A chosen part of the Illyrian army encompassed them with
  levelled spears. Incapable of flight or resistance, they expected their
  fate in silent consternation. Severus mounted the tribunal, sternly
  reproached them with perfidy and cowardice, dismissed them with ignominy
  from the trust which they had betrayed, despoiled them of their splendid
  ornaments, and banished them, on pain of death, to the distance of a
  hundred miles from the capital. During the transaction, another detachment
  had been sent to seize their arms, occupy their camp, and prevent the
  hasty consequences of their despair.
</p>
<p>
  The funeral and consecration of Pertinax was next solemnized with every
  circumstance of sad magnificence. The senate, with a melancholy pleasure,
  performed the last rites to that excellent prince, whom they had loved,
  and still regretted. The concern of his successor was probably less
  sincere; he esteemed the virtues of Pertinax, but those virtues would
  forever have confined his ambition to a private station. Severus
  pronounced his funeral oration with studied eloquence, inward
  satisfaction, and well-acted sorrow; and by this pious regard to his
  memory, convinced the credulous multitude, that he alone was worthy to
  supply his place. Sensible, however, that arms, not ceremonies, must
  assert his claim to the empire, he left Rome at the end of thirty days,
  and without suffering himself to be elated by this easy victory, prepared
  to encounter his more formidable rivals.
</p>
<p>
  The uncommon abilities and fortune of Severus have induced an elegant
  historian to compare him with the first and greatest of the Cæsars.
  The parallel is, at least, imperfect. Where shall we find, in the
  character of Severus, the commanding superiority of soul, the generous
  clemency, and the various genius, which could reconcile and unite the love
  of pleasure, the thirst of knowledge, and the fire of ambition? In one
  instance only, they may be compared, with some degree of propriety, in the
  celerity of their motions, and their civil victories. In less than four
  years, Severus subdued the riches of the East, and the valor of the West.
  He vanquished two competitors of reputation and ability, and defeated
  numerous armies, provided with weapons and discipline equal to his own. In
  that age, the art of fortification, and the principles of tactics, were
  well understood by all the Roman generals; and the constant superiority of
  Severus was that of an artist, who uses the same instruments with more
  skill and industry than his rivals. I shall not, however, enter into a
  minute narrative of these military operations; but as the two civil wars
  against Niger and against Albinus were almost the same in their conduct,
  event, and consequences, I shall collect into one point of view the most
  striking circumstances, tending to develop the character of the conqueror
  and the state of the empire.
</p>
<p>
  Falsehood and insincerity, unsuitable as they seem to the dignity of
  public transactions, offend us with a less degrading idea of meanness,
  than when they are found in the intercourse of private life. In the
  latter, they discover a want of courage; in the other, only a defect of
  power: and, as it is impossible for the most able statesmen to subdue
  millions of followers and enemies by their own personal strength, the
  world, under the name of policy, seems to have granted them a very liberal
  indulgence of craft and dissimulation. Yet the arts of Severus cannot be
  justified by the most ample privileges of state reason. He promised only
  to betray, he flattered only to ruin; and however he might occasionally
  bind himself by oaths and treaties, his conscience, obsequious to his
  interest, always released him from the inconvenient obligation.
</p>
<p>
  If his two competitors, reconciled by their common danger, had advanced
  upon him without delay, perhaps Severus would have sunk under their united
  effort. Had they even attacked him, at the same time, with separate views
  and separate armies, the contest might have been long and doubtful. But
  they fell, singly and successively, an easy prey to the arts as well as
  arms of their subtle enemy, lulled into security by the moderation of his
  professions, and overwhelmed by the rapidity of his action. He first
  marched against Niger, whose reputation and power he the most dreaded: but
  he declined any hostile declarations, suppressed the name of his
  antagonist, and only signified to the senate and people his intention of
  regulating the eastern provinces. In private, he spoke of Niger, his old
  friend and intended successor, with the most affectionate regard, and
  highly applauded his generous design of revenging the murder of Pertinax.
  To punish the vile usurper of the throne, was the duty of every Roman
  general. To persevere in arms, and to resist a lawful emperor,
  acknowledged by the senate, would alone render him criminal. The sons of
  Niger had fallen into his hands among the children of the provincial
  governors, detained at Rome as pledges for the loyalty of their parents.
  As long as the power of Niger inspired terror, or even respect, they were
  educated with the most tender care, with the children of Severus himself;
  but they were soon involved in their father’s ruin, and removed first by
  exile, and afterwards by death, from the eye of public compassion.
</p>
<p>
  Whilst Severus was engaged in his eastern war, he had reason to apprehend
  that the governor of Britain might pass the sea and the Alps, occupy the
  vacant seat of empire, and oppose his return with the authority of the
  senate and the forces of the West. The ambiguous conduct of Albinus, in
  not assuming the Imperial title, left room for negotiation. Forgetting, at
  once, his professions of patriotism, and the jealousy of sovereign power,
  he accepted the precarious rank of Cæsar, as a reward for his fatal
  neutrality. Till the first contest was decided, Severus treated the man,
  whom he had doomed to destruction, with every mark of esteem and regard.
  Even in the letter, in which he announced his victory over Niger, he
  styles Albinus the brother of his soul and empire, sends him the
  affectionate salutations of his wife Julia, and his young family, and
  entreats him to preserve the armies and the republic faithful to their
  common interest. The messengers charged with this letter were instructed
  to accost the Cæsar with respect, to desire a private audience, and
  to plunge their daggers into his heart. The conspiracy was discovered, and
  the too credulous Albinus, at length, passed over to the continent, and
  prepared for an unequal contest with his rival, who rushed upon him at the
  head of a veteran and victorious army.
</p>
<p>
  The military labors of Severus seem inadequate to the importance of his
  conquests. Two engagements, * the one near the Hellespont, the other in
  the narrow defiles of Cilicia, decided the fate of his Syrian competitor;
  and the troops of Europe asserted their usual ascendant over the
  effeminate natives of Asia. The battle of Lyons, where one hundred and
  fifty thousand Romans were engaged, was equally fatal to Albinus. The
  valor of the British army maintained, indeed, a sharp and doubtful
  contest, with the hardy discipline of the Illyrian legions. The fame and
  person of Severus appeared, during a few moments, irrecoverably lost, till
  that warlike prince rallied his fainting troops, and led them on to a
  decisive victory. The war was finished by that memorable day.
</p>
<p>
  The civil wars of modern Europe have been distinguished, not only by the
  fierce animosity, but likewise by the obstinate perseverance, of the
  contending factions. They have generally been justified by some principle,
  or, at least, colored by some pretext, of religion, freedom, or loyalty.
  The leaders were nobles of independent property and hereditary influence.
  The troops fought like men interested in the decision of the quarrel; and
  as military spirit and party zeal were strongly diffused throughout the
  whole community, a vanquished chief was immediately supplied with new
  adherents, eager to shed their blood in the same cause. But the Romans,
  after the fall of the republic, combated only for the choice of masters.
  Under the standard of a popular candidate for empire, a few enlisted from
  affection, some from fear, many from interest, none from principle. The
  legions, uninflamed by party zeal, were allured into civil war by liberal
  donatives, and still more liberal promises. A defeat, by disabling the
  chief from the performance of his engagements, dissolved the mercenary
  allegiance of his followers, and left them to consult their own safety by
  a timely desertion of an unsuccessful cause. It was of little moment to
  the provinces, under whose name they were oppressed or governed; they were
  driven by the impulsion of the present power, and as soon as that power
  yielded to a superior force, they hastened to implore the clemency of the
  conqueror, who, as he had an immense debt to discharge, was obliged to
  sacrifice the most guilty countries to the avarice of his soldiers. In the
  vast extent of the Roman empire, there were few fortified cities capable
  of protecting a routed army; nor was there any person, or family, or order
  of men, whose natural interest, unsupported by the powers of government,
  was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking party.
</p>
<p>
  Yet, in the contest between Niger and Severus, a single city deserves an
  honorable exception. As Byzantium was one of the greatest passages from
  Europe into Asia, it had been provided with a strong garrison, and a fleet
  of five hundred vessels was anchored in the harbor. The impetuosity of
  Severus disappointed this prudent scheme of defence; he left to his
  generals the siege of Byzantium, forced the less guarded passage of the
  Hellespont, and, impatient of a meaner enemy, pressed forward to encounter
  his rival. Byzantium, attacked by a numerous and increasing army, and
  afterwards by the whole naval power of the empire, sustained a siege of
  three years, and remained faithful to the name and memory of Niger. The
  citizens and soldiers (we know not from what cause) were animated with
  equal fury; several of the principal officers of Niger, who despaired of,
  or who disdained, a pardon, had thrown themselves into this last refuge:
  the fortifications were esteemed impregnable, and, in the defence of the
  place, a celebrated engineer displayed all the mechanic powers known to
  the ancients. Byzantium, at length, surrendered to famine. The magistrates
  and soldiers were put to the sword, the walls demolished, the privileges
  suppressed, and the destined capital of the East subsisted only as an open
  village, subject to the insulting jurisdiction of Perinthus. The historian
  Dion, who had admired the flourishing, and lamented the desolate, state of
  Byzantium, accused the revenge of Severus, for depriving the Roman people
  of the strongest bulwark against the barbarians of Pontus and Asia The
  truth of this observation was but too well justified in the succeeding
  age, when the Gothic fleets covered the Euxine, and passed through the
  undefined Bosphorus into the centre of the Mediterranean.
</p>
<p>
  Both Niger and Albinus were discovered and put to death in their flight
  from the field of battle. Their fate excited neither surprise nor
  compassion. They had staked their lives against the chance of empire, and
  suffered what they would have inflicted; nor did Severus claim the
  arrogant superiority of suffering his rivals to live in a private station.
  But his unforgiving temper, stimulated by avarice, indulged a spirit of
  revenge, where there was no room for apprehension. The most considerable
  of the provincials, who, without any dislike to the fortunate candidate,
  had obeyed the governor under whose authority they were accidentally
  placed, were punished by death, exile, and especially by the confiscation
  of their estates. Many cities of the East were stripped of their ancient
  honors, and obliged to pay, into the treasury of Severus, four times the
  amount of the sums contributed by them for the service of Niger.
</p>
<p>
  Till the final decision of the war, the cruelty of Severus was, in some
  measure, restrained by the uncertainty of the event, and his pretended
  reverence for the senate. The head of Albinus, accompanied with a menacing
  letter, announced to the Romans that he was resolved to spare none of the
  adherents of his unfortunate competitors. He was irritated by the just
  suspicion that he had never possessed the affections of the senate, and he
  concealed his old malevolence under the recent discovery of some
  treasonable correspondences. Thirty-five senators, however, accused of
  having favored the party of Albinus, he freely pardoned, and, by his
  subsequent behavior, endeavored to convince them, that he had forgotten,
  as well as forgiven, their supposed offences. But, at the same time, he
  condemned forty-one other senators, whose names history has recorded;
  their wives, children, and clients attended them in death, * and the
  noblest provincials of Spain and Gaul were involved in the same ruin. Such
  rigid justice—for so he termed it—was, in the opinion of
  Severus, the only conduct capable of insuring peace to the people or
  stability to the prince; and he condescended slightly to lament, that to
  be mild, it was necessary that he should first be cruel.
</p>
<p>
  The true interest of an absolute monarch generally coincides with that of
  his people. Their numbers, their wealth, their order, and their security,
  are the best and only foundations of his real greatness; and were he
  totally devoid of virtue, prudence might supply its place, and would
  dictate the same rule of conduct. Severus considered the Roman empire as
  his property, and had no sooner secured the possession, than he bestowed
  his care on the cultivation and improvement of so valuable an acquisition.
  Salutary laws, executed with inflexible firmness, soon corrected most of
  the abuses with which, since the death of Marcus, every part of the
  government had been infected. In the administration of justice, the
  judgments of the emperor were characterized by attention, discernment, and
  impartiality; and whenever he deviated from the strict line of equity, it
  was generally in favor of the poor and oppressed; not so much indeed from
  any sense of humanity, as from the natural propensity of a despot to
  humble the pride of greatness, and to sink all his subjects to the same
  common level of absolute dependence. His expensive taste for building,
  magnificent shows, and above all a constant and liberal distribution of
  corn and provisions, were the surest means of captivating the affection of
  the Roman people. The misfortunes of civil discord were obliterated. The
  calm of peace and prosperity was once more experienced in the provinces;
  and many cities, restored by the munificence of Severus, assumed the title
  of his colonies, and attested by public monuments their gratitude and
  felicity. The fame of the Roman arms was revived by that warlike and
  successful emperor, and he boasted, with a just pride, that, having
  received the empire oppressed with foreign and domestic wars, he left it
  established in profound, universal, and honorable peace.
</p>
<p>
  Although the wounds of civil war appeared completely healed, its mortal
  poison still lurked in the vitals of the constitution. Severus possessed a
  considerable share of vigor and ability; but the daring soul of the first
  Cæsar, or the deep policy of Augustus, were scarcely equal to the
  task of curbing the insolence of the victorious legions. By gratitude, by
  misguided policy, by seeming necessity, Severus was reduced to relax the
  nerves of discipline. The vanity of his soldiers was flattered with the
  honor of wearing gold rings; their ease was indulged in the permission of
  living with their wives in the idleness of quarters. He increased their
  pay beyond the example of former times, and taught them to expect, and
  soon to claim, extraordinary donatives on every public occasion of danger
  or festivity. Elated by success, enervated by luxury, and raised above the
  level of subjects by their dangerous privileges, they soon became
  incapable of military fatigue, oppressive to the country, and impatient of
  a just subordination. Their officers asserted the superiority of rank by a
  more profuse and elegant luxury. There is still extant a letter of
  Severus, lamenting the licentious stage of the army, * and exhorting one
  of his generals to begin the necessary reformation from the tribunes
  themselves; since, as he justly observes, the officer who has forfeited
  the esteem, will never command the obedience, of his soldiers. Had the
  emperor pursued the train of reflection, he would have discovered, that
  the primary cause of this general corruption might be ascribed, not indeed
  to the example, but to the pernicious indulgence, however, of the
  commander-in-chief.
</p>
<p>
  The Prætorians, who murdered their emperor and sold the empire, had
  received the just punishment of their treason; but the necessary, though
  dangerous, institution of guards was soon restored on a new model by
  Severus, and increased to four times the ancient number. Formerly these
  troops had been recruited in Italy; and as the adjacent provinces
  gradually imbibed the softer manners of Rome, the levies were extended to
  Macedonia, Noricum, and Spain. In the room of these elegant troops, better
  adapted to the pomp of courts than to the uses of war, it was established
  by Severus, that from all the legions of the frontiers, the soldiers most
  distinguished for strength, valor, and fidelity, should be occasionally
  draughted; and promoted, as an honor and reward, into the more eligible
  service of the guards. By this new institution, the Italian youth were
  diverted from the exercise of arms, and the capital was terrified by the
  strange aspect and manners of a multitude of barbarians. But Severus
  flattered himself, that the legions would consider these chosen Prætorians
  as the representatives of the whole military order; and that the present
  aid of fifty thousand men, superior in arms and appointments to any force
  that could be brought into the field against them, would forever crush the
  hopes of rebellion, and secure the empire to himself and his posterity.
</p>
<p>
  The command of these favored and formidable troops soon became the first
  office of the empire. As the government degenerated into military
  despotism, the Prætorian Præfect, who in his origin had been a
  simple captain of the guards, * was placed not only at the head of the
  army, but of the finances, and even of the law. In every department of
  administration, he represented the person, and exercised the authority, of
  the emperor. The first præfect who enjoyed and abused this immense
  power was Plautianus, the favorite minister of Severus. His reign lasted
  above ten years, till the marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of
  the emperor, which seemed to assure his fortune, proved the occasion of
  his ruin. The animosities of the palace, by irritating the ambition and
  alarming the fears of Plautianus, threatened to produce a revolution, and
  obliged the emperor, who still loved him, to consent with reluctance to
  his death. After the fall of Plautianus, an eminent lawyer, the celebrated
  Papinian, was appointed to execute the motley office of Prætorian Præfect.
</p>
<p>
  Till the reign of Severus, the virtue and even the good sense of the
  emperors had been distinguished by their zeal or affected reverence for
  the senate, and by a tender regard to the nice frame of civil policy
  instituted by Augustus. But the youth of Severus had been trained in the
  implicit obedience of camps, and his riper years spent in the despotism of
  military command. His haughty and inflexible spirit could not discover,
  or would not acknowledge, the advantage of preserving an intermediate
  power, however imaginary, between the emperor and the army. He disdained
  to profess himself the servant of an assembly that detested his person and
  trembled at his frown; he issued his commands, where his requests would
  have proved as effectual; assumed the conduct and style of a sovereign and
  a conqueror, and exercised, without disguise, the whole legislative, as
  well as the executive power.
</p>
<p>
  The victory over the senate was easy and inglorious. Every eye and every
  passion were directed to the supreme magistrate, who possessed the arms
  and treasure of the state; whilst the senate, neither elected by the
  people, nor guarded by military force, nor animated by public spirit,
  rested its declining authority on the frail and crumbling basis of ancient
  opinion. The fine theory of a republic insensibly vanished, and made way
  for the more natural and substantial feelings of monarchy. As the freedom
  and honors of Rome were successively communicated to the provinces, in
  which the old government had been either unknown, or was remembered with
  abhorrence, the tradition of republican maxims was gradually obliterated.
  The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines observe, with a malicious
  pleasure, that although the sovereign of Rome, in compliance with an
  obsolete prejudice, abstained from the name of king, he possessed the full
  measure of regal power. In the reign of Severus, the senate was filled
  with polished and eloquent slaves from the eastern provinces, who
  justified personal flattery by speculative principles of servitude. These
  new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleasure by the court, and
  with patience by the people, when they inculcated the duty of passive
  obedience, and descanted on the inevitable mischiefs of freedom. The
  lawyers and historians concurred in teaching, that the Imperial authority
  was held, not by the delegated commission, but by the irrevocable
  resignation of the senate; that the emperor was freed from the restraint
  of civil laws, could command by his arbitrary will the lives and fortunes
  of his subjects, and might dispose of the empire as of his private
  patrimony. The most eminent of the civil lawyers, and particularly
  Papinian, Paulus, and Ulpian, flourished under the house of Severus; and
  the Roman jurisprudence, having closely united itself with the system of
  monarchy, was supposed to have attained its full majority and perfection.
</p>
<p>
  The contemporaries of Severus in the enjoyment of the peace and glory of
  his reign, forgave the cruelties by which it had been introduced.
  Posterity, who experienced the fatal effects of his maxims and example,
  justly considered him as the principal author of the decline of the Roman
  empire.
