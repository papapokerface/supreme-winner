  Whenever Tacitus indulges himself in those beautiful episodes, in which he
  relates some domestic transaction of the Germans or of the Parthians, his
  principal object is to relieve the attention of the reader from a uniform
  scene of vice and misery. From the reign of Augustus to the time of
  Alexander Severus, the enemies of Rome were in her bosom—the tyrants
  and the soldiers; and her prosperity had a very distant and feeble
  interest in the revolutions that might happen beyond the Rhine and the
  Euphrates. But when the military order had levelled, in wild anarchy, the
  power of the prince, the laws of the senate, and even the discipline of
  the camp, the barbarians of the North and of the East, who had long
  hovered on the frontier, boldly attacked the provinces of a declining
  monarchy. Their vexatious inroads were changed into formidable irruptions,
  and, after a long vicissitude of mutual calamities, many tribes of the
  victorious invaders established themselves in the provinces of the Roman
  Empire. To obtain a clearer knowledge of these great events, we shall
  endeavor to form a previous idea of the character, forces, and designs of
  those nations who avenged the cause of Hannibal and Mithridates.
</p>
<p>
  In the more early ages of the world, whilst the forest that covered Europe
  afforded a retreat to a few wandering savages, the inhabitants of Asia
  were already collected into populous cities, and reduced under extensive
  empires the seat of the arts, of luxury, and of despotism. The Assyrians
  reigned over the East, till the sceptre of Ninus and Semiramis dropped
  from the hands of their enervated successors. The Medes and the
  Babylonians divided their power, and were themselves swallowed up in the
  monarchy of the Persians, whose arms could not be confined within the
  narrow limits of Asia. Followed, as it is said, by two millions of men,
  Xerxes, the descendant of Cyrus, invaded Greece. Thirty thousand soldiers,
  under the command of Alexander, the son of Philip, who was intrusted by
  the Greeks with their glory and revenge, were sufficient to subdue Persia.
  The princes of the house of Seleucus usurped and lost the Macedonian
  command over the East. About the same time, that, by an ignominious
  treaty, they resigned to the Romans the country on this side Mount Tarus,
  they were driven by the Parthians, * an obscure horde of Scythian origin,
  from all the provinces of Upper Asia. The formidable power of the
  Parthians, which spread from India to the frontiers of Syria, was in its
  turn subverted by Ardshir, or Artaxerxes; the founder of a new dynasty,
  which, under the name of Sassanides, governed Persia till the invasion of
  the Arabs. This great revolution, whose fatal influence was soon
  experienced by the Romans, happened in the fourth year of Alexander
  Severus, two hundred and twenty-six years after the Christian era.
</p>
<p>
  Artaxerxes had served with great reputation in the armies of Artaban, the
  last king of the Parthians, and it appears that he was driven into exile
  and rebellion by royal ingratitude, the customary reward for superior
  merit. His birth was obscure, and the obscurity equally gave room to the
  aspersions of his enemies, and the flattery of his adherents. If we
  credit the scandal of the former, Artaxerxes sprang from the illegitimate
  commerce of a tanner’s wife with a common soldier. The latter represent
  him as descended from a branch of the ancient kings of Persia, though
  time and misfortune had gradually reduced his ancestors to the humble
  station of private citizens. As the lineal heir of the monarchy, he
  asserted his right to the throne, and challenged the noble task of
  delivering the Persians from the oppression under which they groaned
  above five centuries since the death of Darius. The Parthians were
  defeated in three great battles. * In the last of these their king
  Artaban was slain, and the spirit of the nation was forever broken. The
  authority of Artaxerxes was solemnly acknowledged in a great assembly
  held at Balch in Khorasan. Two younger branches of the royal house of
  Arsaces were confounded among the prostrate satraps. A third, more
  mindful of ancient grandeur than of present necessity, attempted to
  retire, with a numerous train of vessels, towards their kinsman, the king
  of Armenia; but this little army of deserters was intercepted, and cut
  off, by the vigilance of the conqueror, who boldly assumed the double
  diadem, and the title of King of Kings, which had been enjoyed by his
  predecessor. But these pompous titles, instead of gratifying the vanity
  of the Persian, served only to admonish him of his duty, and to inflame
  in his soul the ambition of restoring in their full splendor, the
  religion and empire of Cyrus.
</p>
<p>
  I. During the long servitude of Persia under the Macedonian and the
  Parthian yoke, the nations of Europe and Asia had mutually adopted and
  corrupted each other’s superstitions. The Arsacides, indeed, practised the
  worship of the Magi; but they disgraced and polluted it with a various
  mixture of foreign idolatry. * The memory of Zoroaster, the ancient
  prophet and philosopher of the Persians, was still revered in the East;
  but the obsolete and mysterious language, in which the Zendavesta was
  composed, opened a field of dispute to seventy sects, who variously
  explained the fundamental doctrines of their religion, and were all
  indifferently derided by a crowd of infidels, who rejected the divine
  mission and miracles of the prophet. To suppress the idolaters, reunite
  the schismatics, and confute the unbelievers, by the infallible decision
  of a general council, the pious Artaxerxes summoned the Magi from all
  parts of his dominions. These priests, who had so long sighed in contempt
  and obscurity obeyed the welcome summons; and, on the appointed day,
  appeared, to the number of about eighty thousand. But as the debates of so
  tumultuous an assembly could not have been directed by the authority of
  reason, or influenced by the art of policy, the Persian synod was reduced,
  by successive operations, to forty thousand, to four thousand, to four
  hundred, to forty, and at last to seven Magi, the most respected for their
  learning and piety. One of these, Erdaviraph, a young but holy prelate,
  received from the hands of his brethren three cups of soporiferous wine.
  He drank them off, and instantly fell into a long and profound sleep. As
  soon as he waked, he related to the king and to the believing multitude,
  his journey to heaven, and his intimate conferences with the Deity. Every
  doubt was silenced by this supernatural evidence; and the articles of the
  faith of Zoroaster were fixed with equal authority and precision. A short
  delineation of that celebrated system will be found useful, not only to
  display the character of the Persian nation, but to illustrate many of
  their most important transactions, both in peace and war, with the Roman
  empire.
</p>
<p>
  The great and fundamental article of the system was the celebrated
  doctrine of the two principles; a bold and injudicious attempt of Eastern
  philosophy to reconcile the existence of moral and physical evil with the
  attributes of a beneficent Creator and Governor of the world. The first
  and original Being, in whom, or by whom, the universe exists, is
  denominated in the writings of Zoroaster, <i>Time without bounds</i>;
  but it must be confessed, that this infinite substance seems rather a
  metaphysical abstraction of the mind than a real object endowed with
  self-consciousness, or possessed of moral perfections. From either the
  blind or the intelligent operation of this infinite Time, which bears but
  too near an affinity with the chaos of the Greeks, the two secondary but
  active principles of the universe were from all eternity produced, Ormusd
  and Ahriman, each of them possessed of the powers of creation, but each
  disposed, by his invariable nature, to exercise them with different
  designs. * The principle of good is eternally absorbed in light; the
  principle of evil eternally buried in darkness. The wise benevolence of
  Ormusd formed man capable of virtue, and abundantly provided his fair
  habitation with the materials of happiness. By his vigilant providence,
  the motion of the planets, the order of the seasons, and the temperate
  mixture of the elements, are preserved. But the malice of Ahriman has long
  since pierced <i>Ormusd’s egg</i>; or, in other words, has violated the
  harmony of his works. Since that fatal eruption, the most minute articles
  of good and evil are intimately intermingled and agitated together; the
  rankest poisons spring up amidst the most salutary plants; deluges,
  earthquakes, and conflagrations attest the conflict of Nature, and the
  little world of man is perpetually shaken by vice and misfortune. Whilst
  the rest of human kind are led away captives in the chains of their
  infernal enemy, the faithful Persian alone reserves his religious
  adoration for his friend and protector Ormusd, and fights under his banner
  of light, in the full confidence that he shall, in the last day, share the
  glory of his triumph. At that decisive period, the enlightened wisdom of
  goodness will render the power of Ormusd superior to the furious malice of
  his rival. Ahriman and his followers, disarmed and subdued, will sink into
  their native darkness; and virtue will maintain the eternal peace and
  harmony of the universe.

<h2>
  Chapter VIII: State Of Persia And Restoration Of The Monarchy.—Part
  II.
</h2>
<p>
  The theology of Zoroaster was darkly comprehended by foreigners, and even
  by the far greater number of his disciples; but the most careless
  observers were struck with the philosophic simplicity of the Persian
  worship. “That people,” said Herodotus, “rejects the use of temples, of
  altars, and of statues, and smiles at the folly of those nations who
  imagine that the gods are sprung from, or bear any affinity with, the
  human nature. The tops of the highest mountains are the places chosen for
  sacrifices. Hymns and prayers are the principal worship; the Supreme God,
  who fills the wide circle of heaven, is the object to whom they are
  addressed.” Yet, at the same time, in the true spirit of a polytheist, he
  accuseth them of adoring Earth, Water, Fire, the Winds, and the Sun and
  Moon. But the Persians of every age have denied the charge, and explained
  the equivocal conduct, which might appear to give a color to it. The
  elements, and more particularly Fire, Light, and the Sun, whom they called
  Mithra, were the objects of their religious reverence because they
  considered them as the purest symbols, the noblest productions, and the
  most powerful agents of the Divine Power and Nature.
</p>
<p>
  Every mode of religion, to make a deep and lasting impression on the human
  mind, must exercise our obedience, by enjoining practices of devotion, for
  which we can assign no reason; and must acquire our esteem, by inculcating
  moral duties analogous to the dictates of our own hearts. The religion of
  Zoroaster was abundantly provided with the former and possessed a
  sufficient portion of the latter. At the age of puberty, the faithful
  Persian was invested with a mysterious girdle, the badge of the divine
  protection; and from that moment all the actions of his life, even the
  most indifferent, or the most necessary, were sanctified by their peculiar
  prayers, ejaculations, or genuflections; the omission of which, under any
  circumstances, was a grievous sin, not inferior in guilt to the violation
  of the moral duties. The moral duties, however, of justice, mercy,
  liberality, &amp;c., were in their turn required of the disciple of
  Zoroaster, who wished to escape the persecution of Ahriman, and to live
  with Ormusd in a blissful eternity, where the degree of felicity will be
  exactly proportioned to the degree of virtue and piety.
</p>
<p>
  But there are some remarkable instances in which Zoroaster lays aside the
  prophet, assumes the legislator, and discovers a liberal concern for
  private and public happiness, seldom to be found among the grovelling or
  visionary schemes of superstition. Fasting and celibacy, the common means
  of purchasing the divine favor, he condemns with abhorrence as a criminal
  rejection of the best gifts of Providence. The saint, in the Magian
  religion, is obliged to beget children, to plant useful trees, to destroy
  noxious animals, to convey water to the dry lands of Persia, and to work
  out his salvation by pursuing all the labors of agriculture. * We may
  quote from the Zendavesta a wise and benevolent maxim, which compensates
  for many an absurdity. “He who sows the ground with care and diligence
  acquires a greater stock of religious merit than he could gain by the
  repetition of ten thousand prayers.” In the spring of every year a
  festival was celebrated, destined to represent the primitive equality, and
  the present connection, of mankind. The stately kings of Persia,
  exchanging their vain pomp for more genuine greatness, freely mingled with
  the humblest but most useful of their subjects. On that day the husbandmen
  were admitted, without distinction, to the table of the king and his
  satraps. The monarch accepted their petitions, inquired into their
  grievances, and conversed with them on the most equal terms. “From your
  labors,” was he accustomed to say, (and to say with truth, if not with
  sincerity,) “from your labors we receive our subsistence; you derive your
  tranquillity from our vigilance: since, therefore, we are mutually
  necessary to each other, let us live together like brothers in concord and
  love.” Such a festival must indeed have degenerated, in a wealthy and
  despotic empire, into a theatrical representation; but it was at least a
  comedy well worthy of a royal audience, and which might sometimes imprint
  a salutary lesson on the mind of a young prince.
</p>
<p>
  Had Zoroaster, in all his institutions, invariably supported this exalted
  character, his name would deserve a place with those of Numa and
  Confucius, and his system would be justly entitled to all the applause,
  which it has pleased some of our divines, and even some of our
  philosophers, to bestow on it. But in that motley composition, dictated by
  reason and passion, by enthusiasm and by selfish motives, some useful and
  sublime truths were disgraced by a mixture of the most abject and
  dangerous superstition. The Magi, or sacerdotal order, were extremely
  numerous, since, as we have already seen, fourscore thousand of them were
  convened in a general council. Their forces were multiplied by discipline.
  A regular hierarchy was diffused through all the provinces of Persia; and
  the Archimagus, who resided at Balch, was respected as the visible head of
  the church, and the lawful successor of Zoroaster. The property of the
  Magi was very considerable. Besides the less invidious possession of a
  large tract of the most fertile lands of Media, they levied a general tax
  on the fortunes and the industry of the Persians. “Though your good
  works,” says the interested prophet, “exceed in number the leaves of the
  trees, the drops of rain, the stars in the heaven, or the sands on the
  sea-shore, they will all be unprofitable to you, unless they are accepted
  by the <i>destour</i>, or priest. To obtain the acceptation of this
  guide to salvation, you must faithfully pay him <i>tithes</i> of all you
  possess, of your goods, of your lands, and of your money. If the destour
  be satisfied, your soul will escape hell tortures; you will secure praise
  in this world and happiness in the next. For the destours are the teachers
  of religion; they know all things, and they deliver all men.” *
</p>
<p>
  These convenient maxims of reverence and implicit faith were doubtless imprinted
  with care on the tender minds of youth; since the Magi were the masters of
  education in Persia, and to their hands the children even of the royal
  family were intrusted. The Persian priests, who were of a speculative
  genius, preserved and investigated the secrets of Oriental philosophy; and
  acquired, either by superior knowledge, or superior art, the reputation of
  being well versed in some occult sciences, which have derived their
  appellation from the Magi. Those of more active dispositions mixed with
  the world in courts and cities; and it is observed, that the
  administration of Artaxerxes was in a great measure directed by the
  counsels of the sacerdotal order, whose dignity, either from policy or
  devotion, that prince restored to its ancient splendor.
</p>
<p>
  The first counsel of the Magi was agreeable to the unsociable genius of
  their faith, to the practice of ancient kings, and even to the example of
  their legislator, who had fallen a victim to a religious war, excited by his own
  intolerant zeal. By an edict of Artaxerxes, the exercise of every worship,
  except that of Zoroaster, was severely prohibited. The temples of the
  Parthians, and the statues of their deified monarchs, were thrown down
  with ignominy. The sword of Aristotle (such was the name given by the
  Orientals to the polytheism and philosophy of the Greeks) was easily
  broken; the flames of persecution soon reached the more stubborn Jews and
  Christians; nor did they spare the heretics of their own nation and
  religion. The majesty of Ormusd, who was jealous of a rival, was seconded
  by the despotism of Artaxerxes, who could not suffer a rebel; and the
  schismatics within his vast empire were soon reduced to the inconsiderable
  number of eighty thousand. * This spirit of persecution reflects dishonor
  on the religion of Zoroaster; but as it was not productive of any civil
  commotion, it served to strengthen the new monarchy, by uniting all the
  various inhabitants of Persia in the bands of religious zeal.
</p>
<p>
  II. Artaxerxes, by his valor and conduct, had wrested the sceptre of the
  East from the ancient royal family of Parthia. There still remained the
  more difficult task of establishing, throughout the vast extent of Persia,
  a uniform and vigorous administration. The weak indulgence of the
  Arsacides had resigned to their sons and brothers the principal provinces,
  and the greatest offices of the kingdom in the nature of hereditary
  possessions. The <i>vitaxæ</i>, or eighteen most powerful satraps, were permitted
  to assume the regal title; and the vain pride of the monarch was delighted
  with a nominal dominion over so many vassal kings. Even tribes of
  barbarians in their mountains, and the Greek cities of Upper Asia, within
  their walls, scarcely acknowledged, or seldom obeyed, any superior; and
  the Parthian empire exhibited, under other names, a lively image of the
  feudal system which has since prevailed in Europe. But the active victor,
  at the head of a numerous and disciplined army, visited in person every
  province of Persia. The defeat of the boldest rebels, and the reduction of
  the strongest fortifications, diffused the terror of his arms, and
  prepared the way for the peaceful reception of his authority. An obstinate
  resistance was fatal to the chiefs; but their followers were treated with
  lenity. A cheerful submission was rewarded with honors and riches, but the
  prudent Artaxerxes, suffering no person except himself to assume the title
  of king, abolished every intermediate power between the throne and the
  people. His kingdom, nearly equal in extent to modern Persia, was, on
  every side, bounded by the sea, or by great rivers; by the Euphrates, the
  Tigris, the Araxes, the Oxus, and the Indus, by the Caspian Sea, and the
  Gulf of Persia. That country was computed to contain, in the last century,
  five hundred and fifty-four cities, sixty thousand villages, and about
  forty millions of souls. If we compare the administration of the house of
  Sassan with that of the house of Sefi, the political influence of the
  Magian with that of the Mahometan religion, we shall probably infer, that
  the kingdom of Artaxerxes contained at least as great a number of cities,
  villages, and inhabitants. But it must likewise be confessed, that in
  every age the want of harbors on the sea-coast, and the scarcity of fresh
  water in the inland provinces, have been very unfavorable to the commerce
  and agriculture of the Persians; who, in the calculation of their numbers,
  seem to have indulged one of the meanest, though most common, artifices of
  national vanity.
</p>
<p>
  As soon as the ambitious mind of Artaxerxes had triumphed ever the
  resistance of his vassals, he began to threaten the neighboring states,
  who, during the long slumber of his predecessors, had insulted Persia with
  impunity. He obtained some easy victories over the wild Scythians and the
  effeminate Indians; but the Romans were an enemy, who, by their past
  injuries and present power, deserved the utmost efforts of his arms. A
  forty years’ tranquillity, the fruit of valor and moderation, had
  succeeded the victories of Trajan. During the period that elapsed from the
  accession of Marcus to the reign of Alexander, the Roman and the Parthian
  empires were twice engaged in war; and although the whole strength of the
  Arsacides contended with a part only of the forces of Rome, the event was
  most commonly in favor of the latter. Macrinus, indeed, prompted by his
  precarious situation and pusillanimous temper, purchased a peace at the
  expense of near two millions of our money; but the generals of Marcus, the
  emperor Severus, and his son, erected many trophies in Armenia,
  Mesopotamia, and Assyria. Among their exploits, the imperfect relation of
  which would have unseasonably interrupted the more important series of
  domestic revolutions, we shall only mention the repeated calamities of the
  two great cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon.
</p>
<p>
  Seleucia, on the western bank of the Tigris, about forty-five miles to the
  north of ancient Babylon, was the capital of the Macedonian conquests in
  Upper Asia. Many ages after the fall of their empire, Seleucia retained
  the genuine characters of a Grecian colony, arts, military virtue, and the
  love of freedom. The independent republic was governed by a senate of
  three hundred nobles; the people consisted of six hundred thousand
  citizens; the walls were strong, and as long as concord prevailed among
  the several orders of the state, they viewed with contempt the power of
  the Parthian: but the madness of faction was sometimes provoked to implore
  the dangerous aid of the common enemy, who was posted almost at the gates
  of the colony. The Parthian monarchs, like the Mogul sovereigns of
  Hindostan, delighted in the pastoral life of their Scythian ancestors; and
  the Imperial camp was frequently pitched in the plain of Ctesiphon, on the
  eastern bank of the Tigris, at the distance of only three miles from
  Seleucia. The innumerable attendants on luxury and despotism resorted to
  the court, and the little village of Ctesiphon insensibly swelled into a
  great city. Under the reign of Marcus, the Roman generals penetrated as
  far as Ctesiphon and Seleucia. They were received as friends by the Greek
  colony; they attacked as enemies the seat of the Parthian kings; yet both
  cities experienced the same treatment. The sack and conflagration of
  Seleucia, with the massacre of three hundred thousand of the inhabitants,
  tarnished the glory of the Roman triumph. Seleucia, already exhausted by
  the neighborhood of a too powerful rival, sunk under the fatal blow; but
  Ctesiphon, in about thirty-three years, had sufficiently recovered its
  strength to maintain an obstinate siege against the emperor Severus. The
  city was, however, taken by assault; the king, who defended it in person,
  escaped with precipitation; a hundred thousand captives, and a rich booty,
  rewarded the fatigues of the Roman soldiers. Notwithstanding these
  misfortunes, Ctesiphon succeeded to Babylon and to Seleucia, as one of the
  great capitals of the East. In summer, the monarch of Persia enjoyed at
  Ecbatana the cool breezes of the mountains of Media; but the mildness of
  the climate engaged him to prefer Ctesiphon for his winter residence.
</p>
<p>
  From these successful inroads the Romans derived no real or lasting
  benefit; nor did they attempt to preserve such distant conquests,
  separated from the provinces of the empire by a large tract of
  intermediate desert. The reduction of the kingdom of Osrhoene was an
  acquisition of less splendor indeed, but of a far more solid advantage.
  That little state occupied the northern and most fertile part of
  Mesopotamia, between the Euphrates and the Tigris. Edessa, its capital,
  was situated about twenty miles beyond the former of those rivers; and the
  inhabitants, since the time of Alexander, were a mixed race of Greeks,
  Arabs, Syrians, and Armenians. The feeble sovereigns of Osrhoene, placed
  on the dangerous verge of two contending empires, were attached from
  inclination to the Parthian cause; but the superior power of Rome exacted
  from them a reluctant homage, which is still attested by their medals.
  After the conclusion of the Parthian war under Marcus, it was judged
  prudent to secure some substantial pledges of their doubtful fidelity.
  Forts were constructed in several parts of the country, and a Roman
  garrison was fixed in the strong town of Nisibis. During the troubles that
  followed the death of Commodus, the princes of Osrhoene attempted to shake
  off the yoke; but the stern policy of Severus confirmed their dependence,
  and the perfidy of Caracalla completed the easy conquest. Abgarus, the
  last king of Edessa, was sent in chains to Rome, his dominions reduced
  into a province, and his capital dignified with the rank of colony; and
  thus the Romans, about ten years before the fall of the Parthian monarchy,
  obtained a firm and permanent establishment beyond the Euphrates.
</p>
<p>
  Prudence as well as glory might have justified a war on the side of
  Artaxerxes, had his views been confined to the defence or acquisition of a
  useful frontier. but the ambitious Persian openly avowed a far more
  extensive design of conquest; and he thought himself able to support his
  lofty pretensions by the arms of reason as well as by those of power.
  Cyrus, he alleged, had first subdued, and his successors had for a long
  time possessed, the whole extent of Asia, as far as the Propontis and the
  Ægean Sea; the provinces of Caria and Ionia, under their empire, had
  been governed by Persian satraps, and all Egypt, to the confines of
  Æthiopia, had acknowledged their sovereignty. Their rights had been
  suspended, but not destroyed, by a long usurpation; and as soon as he
  received the Persian diadem, which birth and successful valor had placed
  upon his head, the first great duty of his station called upon him to
  restore the ancient limits and splendor of the monarchy. The Great King,
  therefore, (such was the haughty style of his embassies to the emperor
  Alexander,) commanded the Romans instantly to depart from all the
  provinces of his ancestors, and, yielding to the Persians the empire of
  Asia, to content themselves with the undisturbed possession of Europe.
  This haughty mandate was delivered by four hundred of the tallest and most
  beautiful of the Persians; who, by their fine horses, splendid arms, and
  rich apparel, displayed the pride and greatness of their master. Such an
  embassy was much less an offer of negotiation than a declaration of war.
  Both Alexander Severus and Artaxerxes, collecting the military force of
  the Roman and Persian monarchies, resolved in this important contest to
  lead their armies in person.
</p>
<p>
  If we credit what should seem the most authentic of all records, an
  oration, still extant, and delivered by the emperor himself to the senate,
  we must allow that the victory of Alexander Severus was not inferior to
  any of those formerly obtained over the Persians by the son of Philip. The
  army of the Great King consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand horse,
  clothed in complete armor of steel; of seven hundred elephants, with
  towers filled with archers on their backs, and of eighteen hundred
  chariots armed with scythes. This formidable host, the like of which is
  not to be found in eastern history, and has scarcely been imagined in
  eastern romance, was discomfited in a great battle, in which the Roman
  Alexander proved himself an intrepid soldier and a skilful general. The
  Great King fled before his valor; an immense booty, and the conquest of
  Mesopotamia, were the immediate fruits of this signal victory. Such are
  the circumstances of this ostentatious and improbable relation, dictated,
  as it too plainly appears, by the vanity of the monarch, adorned by the
  unblushing servility of his flatterers, and received without contradiction
  by a distant and obsequious senate. Far from being inclined to believe
  that the arms of Alexander obtained any memorable advantage over the
  Persians, we are induced to suspect that all this blaze of imaginary glory
  was designed to conceal some real disgrace.
</p>
<p>
  Our suspicions are confirmed by the authority of a contemporary historian,
  who mentions the virtues of Alexander with respect, and his faults with
  candor. He describes the judicious plan which had been formed for the
  conduct of the war. Three Roman armies were destined to invade Persia at
  the same time, and by different roads. But the operations of the campaign,
  though wisely concerted, were not executed either with ability or success.
  The first of these armies, as soon as it had entered the marshy plains of
  Babylon, towards the artificial conflux of the Euphrates and the Tigris,
  was encompassed by the superior numbers, and destroyed by the arrows of
  the enemy. The alliance of Chosroes, king of Armenia, and the long tract
  of mountainous country, in which the Persian cavalry was of little
  service, opened a secure entrance into the heart of Media, to the second
  of the Roman armies. These brave troops laid waste the adjacent provinces,
  and by several successful actions against Artaxerxes, gave a faint color
  to the emperor’s vanity. But the retreat of this victorious army was
  imprudent, or at least unfortunate. In repassing the mountains, great
  numbers of soldiers perished by the badness of the roads, and the severity
  of the winter season. It had been resolved, that whilst these two great
  detachments penetrated into the opposite extremes of the Persian
  dominions, the main body, under the command of Alexander himself, should
  support their attack, by invading the centre of the kingdom. But the
  unexperienced youth, influenced by his mother’s counsels, and perhaps by
  his own fears, deserted the bravest troops, and the fairest prospect of
  victory; and after consuming in Mesopotamia an inactive and inglorious
  summer, he led back to Antioch an army diminished by sickness, and
  provoked by disappointment. The behavior of Artaxerxes had been very
  different. Flying with rapidity from the hills of Media to the marshes of
  the Euphrates, he had everywhere opposed the invaders in person; and in
  either fortune had united with the ablest conduct the most undaunted
  resolution. But in several obstinate engagements against the veteran
  legions of Rome, the Persian monarch had lost the flower of his troops.
  Even his victories had weakened his power. The favorable opportunities of
  the absence of Alexander, and of the confusions that followed that
  emperor’s death, presented themselves in vain to his ambition. Instead of
  expelling the Romans, as he pretended, from the continent of Asia, he
  found himself unable to wrest from their hands the little province of
  Mesopotamia.
</p>
<p>
  The reign of Artaxerxes, which, from the last defeat of the Parthians,
  lasted only fourteen years, forms a memorable æra in the history of
  the East, and even in that of Rome. His character seems to have been
  marked by those bold and commanding features, that generally distinguish
  the princes who conquer, from those who inherit, an empire. Till the last
  period of the Persian monarchy, his code of laws was respected as the
  groundwork of their civil and religious policy. Several of his sayings are
  preserved. One of them in particular discovers a deep insight into the
  constitution of government. “The authority of the prince,” said
  Artaxerxes, “must be defended by a military force; that force can only be
  maintained by taxes; all taxes must, at last, fall upon agriculture; and
  agriculture can never flourish except under the protection of justice and
  moderation.” Artaxerxes bequeathed his new empire, and his ambitious
  designs against the Romans, to Sapor, a son not unworthy of his great
  father; but those designs were too extensive for the power of Persia, and
  served only to involve both nations in a long series of destructive wars
  and reciprocal calamities.
</p>
<p>
  The Persians, long since civilized and corrupted, were very far from
  possessing the martial independence, and the intrepid hardiness, both of
  mind and body, which have rendered the northern barbarians masters of the
  world. The science of war, that constituted the more rational force of
  Greece and Rome, as it now does of Europe, never made any considerable
  progress in the East. Those disciplined evolutions which harmonize and
  animate a confused multitude, were unknown to the Persians. They were
  equally unskilled in the arts of constructing, besieging, or defending
  regular fortifications. They trusted more to their numbers than to their
  courage; more to their courage than to their discipline. The infantry was
  a half-armed, spiritless crowd of peasants, levied in haste by the
  allurements of plunder, and as easily dispersed by a victory as by a
  defeat. The monarch and his nobles transported into the camp the pride and
  luxury of the seraglio. Their military operations were impeded by a
  useless train of women, eunuchs, horses, and camels; and in the midst of a
  successful campaign, the Persian host was often separated or destroyed by
  an unexpected famine.
</p>
<p>
  But the nobles of Persia, in the bosom of luxury and despotism, preserved
  a strong sense of personal gallantry and national honor. From the age of
  seven years they were taught to speak truth, to shoot with the bow, and to
  ride; and it was universally confessed that in the two last of these
  arts they had made a more than common proficiency. The most distinguished
  youth were educated under the monarch’s eye, practised their exercises in
  the gate of his palace, and were severely trained up to the habits of
  temperance and obedience, in their long and laborious parties of hunting.
  In every province, the satrap maintained a like school of military virtue.
  The Persian nobles (so natural is the idea of feudal tenures) received
  from the king’s bounty lands and houses, on the condition of their service
  in war. They were ready on the first summons to mount on horseback, with a
  martial and splendid train of followers, and to join the numerous bodies
  of guards, who were carefully selected from among the most robust slaves,
  and the bravest adventurers of Asia. These armies, both of light and of
  heavy cavalry, equally formidable by the impetuosity of their charge and
  the rapidity of their motions, threatened, as an impending cloud, the
  eastern provinces of the declining empire of Rome.

<pre>The State Of Germany Till The Invasion Of The Barbarians In
The Time Of The Emperor Decius.<br>
</pre>
<p>
  The government and religion of Persia have deserved some notice, from
  their connection with the decline and fall of the Roman empire. We shall
  occasionally mention the Scythian or Sarmatian tribes, * which, with their
  arms and horses, their flocks and herds, their wives and families,
  wandered over the immense plains which spread themselves from the Caspian
  Sea to the Vistula, from the confines of Persia to those of Germany. But
  the warlike Germans, who first resisted, then invaded, and at length
  overturned the Western monarchy of Rome, will occupy a much more important
  place in this history, and possess a stronger, and, if we may use the
  expression, a more domestic, claim to our attention and regard. The most
  civilized nations of modern Europe issued from the woods of Germany; and
  in the rude institutions of those barbarians we may still distinguish the
  original principles of our present laws and manners. In their primitive
  state of simplicity and independence, the Germans were surveyed by the
  discerning eye, and delineated by the masterly pencil, of Tacitus, the
  first of historians who applied the science of philosophy to the study of
  facts. The expressive conciseness of his descriptions has served to
  exercise the diligence of innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the
  genius and penetration of the philosophic historians of our own times. The
  subject, however various and important, has already been so frequently, so
  ably, and so successfully discussed, that it is now grown familiar to the
  reader, and difficult to the writer. We shall therefore content ourselves
  with observing, and indeed with repeating, some of the most important
  circumstances of climate, of manners, and of institutions, which rendered
  the wild barbarians of Germany such formidable enemies to the Roman power.
</p>
<p>
  Ancient Germany, excluding from its independent limits the province
  westward of the Rhine, which had submitted to the Roman yoke, extended
  itself over a third part of Europe. Almost the whole of modern Germany,
  Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Livonia, Prussia, and the greater part
  of Poland, were peopled by the various tribes of one great nation, whose
  complexion, manners, and language denoted a common origin, and preserved a
  striking resemblance. On the west, ancient Germany was divided by the
  Rhine from the Gallic, and on the south, by the Danube, from the Illyrian,
  provinces of the empire. A ridge of hills, rising from the Danube, and
  called the Carpathian Mountains, covered Germany on the side of Dacia or
  Hungary. The eastern frontier was faintly marked by the mutual fears of
  the Germans and the Sarmatians, and was often confounded by the mixture of
  warring and confederating tribes of the two nations. In the remote
  darkness of the north, the ancients imperfectly descried a frozen ocean
  that lay beyond the Baltic Sea, and beyond the Peninsula, or islands of
  Scandinavia.
</p>
<p>
  Some ingenious writers have suspected that Europe was much colder formerly
  than it is at present; and the most ancient descriptions of the climate of
  Germany tend exceedingly to confirm their theory. The general complaints
  of intense frost and eternal winter are perhaps little to be regarded,
  since we have no method of reducing to the accurate standard of the
  thermometer, the feelings, or the expressions, of an orator born in the
  happier regions of Greece or Asia. But I shall select two remarkable
  circumstances of a less equivocal nature. 1. The great rivers which
  covered the Roman provinces, the Rhine and the Danube, were frequently
  frozen over, and capable of supporting the most enormous weights. The
  barbarians, who often chose that severe season for their inroads,
  transported, without apprehension or danger, their numerous armies, their
  cavalry, and their heavy wagons, over a vast and solid bridge of ice.
  Modern ages have not presented an instance of a like phenomenon. 2. The
  reindeer, that useful animal, from whom the savage of the North derives
  the best comforts of his dreary life, is of a constitution that supports,
  and even requires, the most intense cold. He is found on the rock of
  Spitzberg, within ten degrees of the Pole; he seems to delight in the
  snows of Lapland and Siberia: but at present he cannot subsist, much less
  multiply, in any country to the south of the Baltic. In the time of Cæsar
  the reindeer, as well as the elk and the wild bull, was a native of the
  Hercynian forest, which then overshadowed a great part of Germany and
  Poland. The modern improvements sufficiently explain the causes of the
  diminution of the cold. These immense woods have been gradually cleared,
  which intercepted from the earth the rays of the sun. The morasses have
  been drained, and, in proportion as the soil has been cultivated, the air
  has become more temperate. Canada, at this day, is an exact picture of
  ancient Germany. Although situated in the same parallel with the finest
  provinces of France and England, that country experiences the most
  rigorous cold. The reindeer are very numerous, the ground is covered with
  deep and lasting snow, and the great river of St. Lawrence is regularly
  frozen, in a season when the waters of the Seine and the Thames are
  usually free from ice.
</p>
<p>
  It is difficult to ascertain, and easy to exaggerate, the influence of the
  climate of ancient Germany over the minds and bodies of the natives. Many
  writers have supposed, and most have allowed, though, as it should seem,
  without any adequate proof, that the rigorous cold of the North was
  favorable to long life and generative vigor, that the women were more
  fruitful, and the human species more prolific, than in warmer or more
  temperate climates. We may assert, with greater confidence, that the keen
  air of Germany formed the large and masculine limbs of the natives, who
  were, in general, of a more lofty stature than the people of the South,
  gave them a kind of strength better adapted to violent exertions than to
  patient labor, and inspired them with constitutional bravery, which is the
  result of nerves and spirits. The severity of a winter campaign, that
  chilled the courage of the Roman troops, was scarcely felt by these hardy
  children of the North, who, in their turn, were unable to resist the
  summer heats, and dissolved away in languor and sickness under the beams
  of an Italian sun.

  Chapter IX: State Of Germany Until The Barbarians.—Part II.
</h2>
<p>
  There is not anywhere upon the globe a large tract of country, which we
  have discovered destitute of inhabitants, or whose first population can be
  fixed with any degree of historical certainty. And yet, as the most
  philosophic minds can seldom refrain from investigating the infancy of
  great nations, our curiosity consumes itself in toilsome and disappointed
  efforts. When Tacitus considered the purity of the German blood, and the
  forbidding aspect of the country, he was disposed to pronounce those
  barbarians <i>Indigenæ</i>, or natives of the soil. We may allow with
  safety, and perhaps with truth, that ancient Germany was not originally
  peopled by any foreign colonies already formed into a political society;
  but that the name and nation received their existence from the gradual
  union of some wandering savages of the Hercynian woods. To assert those
  savages to have been the spontaneous production of the earth which they
  inhabited would be a rash inference, condemned by religion, and
  unwarranted by reason.
</p>
<p>
  Such rational doubt is but ill suited with the genius of popular vanity.
  Among the nations who have adopted the Mosaic history of the world, the
  ark of Noah has been of the same use, as was formerly to the Greeks and
  Romans the siege of Troy. On a narrow basis of acknowledged truth, an
  immense but rude superstructure of fable has been erected; and the wild
  Irishman, as well as the wild Tartar, could point out the individual son
  of Japhet, from whose loins his ancestors were lineally descended. The
  last century abounded with antiquarians of profound learning and easy
  faith, who, by the dim light of legends and traditions, of conjectures and
  etymologies, conducted the great grandchildren of Noah from the Tower of
  Babel to the extremities of the globe. Of these judicious critics, one of
  the most entertaining was Olaus Rudbeck, professor in the university of
  Upsal. Whatever is celebrated either in history or fable this zealous
  patriot ascribes to his country. From Sweden (which formed so considerable
  a part of ancient Germany) the Greeks themselves derived their
  alphabetical characters, their astronomy, and their religion. Of that
  delightful region (for such it appeared to the eyes of a native) the
  Atlantis of Plato, the country of the Hyperboreans, the gardens of the
  Hesperides, the Fortunate Islands, and even the Elysian Fields, were all
  but faint and imperfect transcripts. A clime so profusely favored by
  Nature could not long remain desert after the flood. The learned Rudbeck
  allows the family of Noah a few years to multiply from eight to about
  twenty thousand persons. He then disperses them into small colonies to
  replenish the earth, and to propagate the human species. The German or
  Swedish detachment (which marched, if I am not mistaken, under the command
  of Askenaz, the son of Gomer, the son of Japhet) distinguished itself by a
  more than common diligence in the prosecution of this great work. The
  northern hive cast its swarms over the greatest part of Europe, Africa,
  and Asia; and (to use the author’s metaphor) the blood circulated from the
  extremities to the heart.
</p>
<p>
  But all this well-labored system of German antiquities is annihilated by a
  single fact, too well attested to admit of any doubt, and of too decisive
  a nature to leave room for any reply. The Germans, in the age of Tacitus,
  were unacquainted with the use of letters; and the use of letters is the
  principal circumstance that distinguishes a civilized people from a herd
  of savages incapable of knowledge or reflection. Without that artificial
  help, the human memory soon dissipates or corrupts the ideas intrusted to
  her charge; and the nobler faculties of the mind, no longer supplied with
  models or with materials, gradually forget their powers; the judgment
  becomes feeble and lethargic, the imagination languid or irregular. Fully
  to apprehend this important truth, let us attempt, in an improved society,
  to calculate the immense distance between the man of learning and the <i>illiterate</i>
  peasant. The former, by reading and reflection, multiplies his own
  experience, and lives in distant ages and remote countries; whilst the
  latter, rooted to a single spot, and confined to a few years of existence,
  surpasses but very little his fellow-laborer, the ox, in the exercise of
  his mental faculties. The same, and even a greater, difference will be
  found between nations than between individuals; and we may safely
  pronounce, that without some species of writing, no people has ever
  preserved the faithful annals of their history, ever made any considerable
  progress in the abstract sciences, or ever possessed, in any tolerable
  degree of perfection, the useful and agreeable arts of life.
</p>
<p>
  Of these arts, the ancient Germans were wretchedly destitute. They passed
  their lives in a state of ignorance and poverty, which it has pleased some
  declaimers to dignify with the appellation of virtuous simplicity. *
  Modern Germany is said to contain about two thousand three hundred walled
  towns. In a much wider extent of country, the geographer Ptolemy could
  discover no more than ninety places which he decorates with the name of
  cities; though, according to our ideas, they would but ill deserve that
  splendid title. We can only suppose them to have been rude fortifications,
  constructed in the centre of the woods, and designed to secure the women,
  children, and cattle, whilst the warriors of the tribe marched out to
  repel a sudden invasion. But Tacitus asserts, as a well-known fact, that
  the Germans, in his time, had <i>no</i> cities; and that they affected
  to despise the works of Roman industry, as places of confinement rather
  than of security. Their edifices were not even contiguous, or formed into
  regular villas; each barbarian fixed his independent dwelling on the spot
  to which a plain, a wood, or a stream of fresh water, had induced him to
  give the preference. Neither stone, nor brick, nor tiles, were employed in
  these slight habitations. They were indeed no more than low huts, of a
  circular figure, built of rough timber, thatched with straw, and pierced
  at the top to leave a free passage for the smoke. In the most inclement
  winter, the hardy German was satisfied with a scanty garment made of the
  skin of some animal. The nations who dwelt towards the North clothed
  themselves in furs; and the women manufactured for their own use a coarse
  kind of linen. The game of various sorts, with which the forests of
  Germany were plentifully stocked, supplied its inhabitants with food and
  exercise. Their monstrous herds of cattle, less remarkable indeed for
  their beauty than for their utility, formed the principal object of their
  wealth. A small quantity of corn was the only produce exacted from the
  earth; the use of orchards or artificial meadows was unknown to the
  Germans; nor can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a people,
  whose prosperity every year experienced a general change by a new division
  of the arable lands, and who, in that strange operation, avoided disputes,
  by suffering a great part of their territory to lie waste and without
  tillage.
</p>
<p>
  Gold, silver, and iron, were extremely scarce in Germany. Its barbarous
  inhabitants wanted both skill and patience to investigate those rich veins
  of silver, which have so liberally rewarded the attention of the princes
  of Brunswick and Saxony. Sweden, which now supplies Europe with iron, was
  equally ignorant of its own riches; and the appearance of the arms of the
  Germans furnished a sufficient proof how little iron they were able to
  bestow on what they must have deemed the noblest use of that metal. The
  various transactions of peace and war had introduced some Roman coins
  (chiefly silver) among the borderers of the Rhine and Danube; but the more
  distant tribes were absolutely unacquainted with the use of money, carried
  on their confined traffic by the exchange of commodities, and prized their
  rude earthen vessels as of equal value with the silver vases, the presents
  of Rome to their princes and ambassadors. To a mind capable of reflection,
  such leading facts convey more instruction, than a tedious detail of
  subordinate circumstances. The value of money has been settled by general
  consent to express our wants and our property, as letters were invented to
  express our ideas; and both these institutions, by giving a more active
  energy to the powers and passions of human nature, have contributed to
  multiply the objects they were designed to represent. The use of gold and
  silver is in a great measure factitious; but it would be impossible to
  enumerate the important and various services which agriculture, and all
  the arts, have received from iron, when tempered and fashioned by the
  operation of fire and the dexterous hand of man. Money, in a word, is the
  most universal incitement, iron the most powerful instrument, of human
  industry; and it is very difficult to conceive by what means a people,
  neither actuated by the one, nor seconded by the other, could emerge from
  the grossest barbarism.
</p>
<p>
  If we contemplate a savage nation in any part of the globe, a supine
  indolence and a carelessness of futurity will be found to constitute their
  general character. In a civilized state every faculty of man is expanded
  and exercised; and the great chain of mutual dependence connects and
  embraces the several members of society. The most numerous portion of it
  is employed in constant and useful labor. The select few, placed by
  fortune above that necessity, can, however, fill up their time by the
  pursuits of interest or glory, by the improvement of their estate or of
  their understanding, by the duties, the pleasures, and even the follies of
  social life. The Germans were not possessed of these varied resources. The
  care of the house and family, the management of the land and cattle, were
  delegated to the old and the infirm, to women and slaves. The lazy
  warrior, destitute of every art that might employ his leisure hours,
  consumed his days and nights in the animal gratifications of sleep and
  food. And yet, by a wonderful diversity of nature, (according to the
  remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkest recesses,) the same
  barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the most restless of
  mankind. They delight in sloth, they detest tranquility. The languid soul,
  oppressed with its own weight, anxiously required some new and powerful
  sensation; and war and danger were the only amusements adequate to its
  fierce temper. The sound that summoned the German to arms was grateful to
  his ear. It roused him from his uncomfortable lethargy, gave him an active
  pursuit, and, by strong exercise of the body, and violent emotions of the
  mind, restored him to a more lively sense of his existence. In the dull
  intervals of peace, these barbarians were immoderately addicted to deep
  gaming and excessive drinking; both of which, by different means, the one
  by inflaming their passions, the other by extinguishing their reason,
  alike relieved them from the pain of thinking. They gloried in passing
  whole days and nights at table; and the blood of friends and relations
  often stained their numerous and drunken assemblies. Their debts of honor
  (for in that light they have transmitted to us those of play) they
  discharged with the most romantic fidelity. The desperate gamester, who
  had staked his person and liberty on a last throw of the dice, patiently
  submitted to the decision of fortune, and suffered himself to be bound,
  chastised, and sold into remote slavery, by his weaker but more lucky
  antagonist.
</p>
<p>
  Strong beer, a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or barley,
  and <i>corrupted</i> (as it is strongly expressed by Tacitus) into a
  certain semblance of wine, was sufficient for the gross purposes of German
  debauchery. But those who had tasted the rich wines of Italy, and
  afterwards of Gaul, sighed for that more delicious species of
  intoxication. They attempted not, however, (as has since been executed
  with so much success,) to naturalize the vine on the banks of the Rhine
  and Danube; nor did they endeavor to procure by industry the materials of
  an advantageous commerce. To solicit by labor what might be ravished by
  arms, was esteemed unworthy of the German spirit. The intemperate thirst
  of strong liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the provinces on
  which art or nature had bestowed those much envied presents. The Tuscan
  who betrayed his country to the Celtic nations, attracted them into Italy
  by the prospect of the rich fruits and delicious wines, the productions of
  a happier climate. And in the same manner the German auxiliaries, invited
  into France during the civil wars of the sixteenth century, were allured
  by the promise of plenteous quarters in the provinces of Champaigne and
  Burgundy. Drunkenness, the most illiberal, but not the most dangerous of
  our <i>vices</i>, was sometimes capable, in a less civilized state of
  mankind, of occasioning a battle, a war, or a revolution.
</p>
<p>
  The climate of ancient Germany has been modified, and the soil fertilized,
  by the labor of ten centuries from the time of Charlemagne. The same
  extent of ground which at present maintains, in ease and plenty, a million
  of husbandmen and artificers, was unable to supply a hundred thousand lazy
  warriors with the simple necessaries of life. The Germans abandoned their
  immense forests to the exercise of hunting, employed in pasturage the most
  considerable part of their lands, bestowed on the small remainder a rude
  and careless cultivation, and then accused the scantiness and sterility of
  a country that refused to maintain the multitude of its inhabitants. When
  the return of famine severely admonished them of the importance of the
  arts, the national distress was sometimes alleviated by the emigration of
  a third, perhaps, or a fourth part of their youth. The possession and the
  enjoyment of property are the pledges which bind a civilized people to an
  improved country. But the Germans, who carried with them what they most
  valued, their arms, their cattle, and their women, cheerfully abandoned
  the vast silence of their woods for the unbounded hopes of plunder and
  conquest. The innumerable swarms that issued, or seemed to issue, from the
  great storehouse of nations, were multiplied by the fears of the
  vanquished, and by the credulity of succeeding ages. And from facts thus
  exaggerated, an opinion was gradually established, and has been supported
  by writers of distinguished reputation, that, in the age of Cæsar
  and Tacitus, the inhabitants of the North were far more numerous than they
  are in our days. A more serious inquiry into the causes of population
  seems to have convinced modern philosophers of the falsehood, and indeed
  the impossibility, of the supposition. To the names of Mariana and of
  Machiavel, we can oppose the equal names of Robertson and Hume.
</p>
<p>
  A warlike nation like the Germans, without either cities, letters, arts,
  or money, found some compensation for this savage state in the enjoyment
  of liberty. Their poverty secured their freedom, since our desires and our
  possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism. “Among the Suiones
  (says Tacitus) riches are held in honor. They are <i>therefore</i>
  subject to an absolute monarch, who, instead of intrusting his people with
  the free use of arms, as is practised in the rest of Germany, commits them
  to the safe custody, not of a citizen, or even of a freedman, but of a
  slave. The neighbors of the Suiones, the Sitones, are sunk even below
  servitude; they obey a woman.” In the mention of these exceptions, the
  great historian sufficiently acknowledges the general theory of
  government. We are only at a loss to conceive by what means riches and
  despotism could penetrate into a remote corner of the North, and
  extinguish the generous flame that blazed with such fierceness on the
  frontier of the Roman provinces, or how the ancestors of those Danes and
  Norwegians, so distinguished in latter ages by their unconquered spirit,
  could thus tamely resign the great character of German liberty. Some
  tribes, however, on the coast of the Baltic, acknowledged the authority of
  kings, though without relinquishing the rights of men, but in the far
  greater part of Germany, the form of government was a democracy, tempered,
  indeed, and controlled, not so much by general and positive laws, as by
  the occasional ascendant of birth or valor, of eloquence or superstition.
</p>
<p>
  Civil governments, in their first institution, are voluntary associations
  for mutual defence. To obtain the desired end, it is absolutely necessary
  that each individual should conceive himself obliged to submit his private
  opinions and actions to the judgment of the greater number of his
  associates. The German tribes were contented with this rude but liberal
  outline of political society. As soon as a youth, born of free parents,
  had attained the age of manhood, he was introduced into the general
  council of his countrymen, solemnly invested with a shield and spear, and
  adopted as an equal and worthy member of the military commonwealth. The
  assembly of the warriors of the tribe was convened at stated seasons, or
  on sudden emergencies. The trial of public offences, the election of
  magistrates, and the great business of peace and war, were determined by
  its independent voice. Sometimes indeed, these important questions were
  previously considered and prepared in a more select council of the
  principal chieftains. The magistrates might deliberate and persuade, the
  people only could resolve and execute; and the resolutions of the Germans
  were for the most part hasty and violent. Barbarians accustomed to place
  their freedom in gratifying the present passion, and their courage in
  overlooking all future consequences, turned away with indignant contempt
  from the remonstrances of justice and policy, and it was the practice to
  signify by a hollow murmur their dislike of such timid counsels. But
  whenever a more popular orator proposed to vindicate the meanest citizen
  from either foreign or domestic injury, whenever he called upon his
  fellow-countrymen to assert the national honor, or to pursue some
  enterprise full of danger and glory, a loud clashing of shields and spears
  expressed the eager applause of the assembly. For the Germans always met
  in arms, and it was constantly to be dreaded, lest an irregular multitude,
  inflamed with faction and strong liquors, should use those arms to
  enforce, as well as to declare, their furious resolves. We may recollect
  how often the diets of Poland have been polluted with blood, and the more
  numerous party has been compelled to yield to the more violent and
  seditious.
</p>
<p>
  A general of the tribe was elected on occasions of danger; and, if the
  danger was pressing and extensive, several tribes concurred in the choice
  of the same general. The bravest warrior was named to lead his countrymen
  into the field, by his example rather than by his commands. But this
  power, however limited, was still invidious. It expired with the war, and
  in time of peace the German tribes acknowledged not any supreme chief.
  Princes were, however, appointed, in the general assembly, to administer
  justice, or rather to compose differences, in their respective districts.
  In the choice of these magistrates, as much regard was shown to birth as
  to merit. To each was assigned, by the public, a guard, and a council of a
  hundred persons, and the first of the princes appears to have enjoyed a
  preeminence of rank and honor which sometimes tempted the Romans to
  compliment him with the regal title.
</p>
<p>
  The comparative view of the powers of the magistrates, in two remarkable
  instances, is alone sufficient to represent the whole system of German
  manners. The disposal of the landed property within their district was
  absolutely vested in their hands, and they distributed it every year
  according to a new division. At the same time they were not authorized to
  punish with death, to imprison, or even to strike a private citizen. A
  people thus jealous of their persons, and careless of their possessions,
  must have been totally destitute of industry and the arts, but animated
  with a high sense of honor and independence.

<h2>
  Chapter IX: State Of Germany Until The Barbarians.—Part III.
</h2>
<p>
  The Germans respected only those duties which they imposed on themselves.
  The most obscure soldier resisted with disdain the authority of the
  magistrates. ”The noblest youths blushed not to be numbered among the
  faithful companions of some renowned chief, to whom they devoted their
  arms and service. A noble emulation prevailed among the companions to
  obtain the first place in the esteem of their chief; amongst the chiefs,
  to acquire the greatest number of valiant companions. To be ever
  surrounded by a band of select youths was the pride and strength of the
  chiefs, their ornament in peace, their defence in war. The glory of such
  distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of their own
  tribe. Presents and embassies solicited their friendship, and the fame of
  their arms often insured victory to the party which they espoused. In the
  hour of danger it was shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valor by
  his companions; shameful for the companions not to equal the valor of
  their chief. To survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy. To
  protect his person, and to adorn his glory with the trophies of their own
  exploits, were the most sacred of their duties. The chiefs combated for
  victory, the companions for the chief. The noblest warriors, whenever
  their native country was sunk into the laziness of peace, maintained their
  numerous bands in some distant scene of action, to exercise their restless
  spirit, and to acquire renown by voluntary dangers. Gifts worthy of
  soldiers—the warlike steed, the bloody and ever victorious lance—were
  the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of their
  chief. The rude plenty of his hospitable board was the only pay that <i>he</i>could
  bestow, or <i>they</i> would accept. War, rapine, and the free-will
  offerings of his friends, supplied the materials of this munificence.” This
  institution, however it might accidentally weaken the several republics,
  invigorated the general character of the Germans, and even ripened amongst
  them all the virtues of which barbarians are susceptible; the faith and
  valor, the hospitality and the courtesy, so conspicuous long afterwards in
  the ages of chivalry. The honorable gifts, bestowed by the chief on his
  brave companions, have been supposed, by an ingenious writer, to contain
  the first rudiments of the fiefs, distributed after the conquest of the
  Roman provinces, by the barbarian lords among their vassals, with a
  similar duty of homage and military service. These conditions are,
  however, very repugnant to the maxims of the ancient Germans, who
  delighted in mutual presents, but without either imposing, or accepting,
  the weight of obligations.
</p>
<p>
  “In the days of chivalry, or more properly of romance, all the men were
  brave and all the women were chaste;” and notwithstanding the latter of
  these virtues is acquired and preserved with much more difficulty than the
  former, it is ascribed, almost without exception, to the wives of the
  ancient Germans. Polygamy was not in use, except among the princes, and
  among them only for the sake of multiplying their alliances. Divorces were
  prohibited by manners rather than by laws. Adulteries were punished as
  rare and inexpiable crimes; nor was seduction justified by example and
  fashion. We may easily discover that Tacitus indulges an honest pleasure
  in the contrast of barbarian virtue with the dissolute conduct of the
  Roman ladies; yet there are some striking circumstances that give an air
  of truth, or at least probability, to the conjugal faith and chastity of
  the Germans.
</p>
<p>
  Although the progress of civilization has undoubtedly contributed to
  assuage the fiercer passions of human nature, it seems to have been less
  favorable to the virtue of chastity, whose most dangerous enemy is the
  softness of the mind. The refinements of life corrupt while they polish
  the intercourse of the sexes. The gross appetite of love becomes most
  dangerous when it is elevated, or rather, indeed, disguised by sentimental
  passion. The elegance of dress, of motion, and of manners, gives a lustre
  to beauty, and inflames the senses through the imagination. Luxurious
  entertainments, midnight dances, and licentious spectacles, present at
  once temptation and opportunity to female frailty. From such dangers the
  unpolished wives of the barbarians were secured by poverty, solitude, and
  the painful cares of a domestic life. The German huts, open, on every
  side, to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy, were a better safeguard of
  conjugal fidelity than the walls, the bolts, and the eunuchs of a Persian
  harem. To this reason another may be added of a more honorable nature.
  The Germans treated their women with esteem and confidence, consulted them
  on every occasion of importance, and fondly believed, that in their
  breasts resided a sanctity and wisdom more than human. Some of the
  interpreters of fate, such as Velleda, in the Batavian war, governed, in
  the name of the deity, the fiercest nations of Germany. The rest of the
  sex, without being adored as goddesses, were respected as the free and
  equal companions of soldiers; associated even by the marriage ceremony to
  a life of toil, of danger, and of glory. In their great invasions, the
  camps of the barbarians were filled with a multitude of women, who
  remained firm and undaunted amidst the sound of arms, the various forms of
  destruction, and the honorable wounds of their sons and husbands. Fainting
  armies of Germans have, more than once, been driven back upon the enemy
  by the generous despair of the women, who dreaded death much less than
  servitude. If the day was irrecoverably lost, they well knew how to
  deliver themselves and their children, with their own hands, from an
  insulting victor. Heroines of such a cast may claim our admiration; but
  they were most assuredly neither lovely nor very susceptible of love.
  Whilst they affected to emulate the stern virtues of <i>man</i>, they
  must have resigned that attractive softness in which principally consist
  the charm and weakness of <i>woman</i>. Conscious pride taught the
  German females to suppress every tender emotion that stood in competition
  with honor, and the first honor of the sex has ever been that of chastity.
  The sentiments and conduct of these high-spirited matrons may, at once, be
  considered as a cause, as an effect, and as a proof of the general
  character of the nation. Female courage, however it may be raised by
  fanaticism, or confirmed by habit, can be only a faint and imperfect
  imitation of the manly valor that distinguishes the age or country in
  which it may be found.
</p>
<p>
  The religious system of the Germans (if the wild opinions of savages can
  deserve that name) was dictated by their wants, their fears, and their
  ignorance. They adored the great visible objects and agents of nature, the
  Sun and the Moon, the Fire and the Earth; together with those imaginary
  deities, who were supposed to preside over the most important occupations
  of human life. They were persuaded, that, by some ridiculous arts of
  divination, they could discover the will of the superior beings, and that
  human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable offering to their
  altars. Some applause has been hastily bestowed on the sublime notion,
  entertained by that people, of the Deity, whom they neither confined
  within the walls of the temple, nor represented by any human figure; but
  when we recollect, that the Germans were unskilled in architecture, and
  totally unacquainted with the art of sculpture, we shall readily assign
  the true reason of a scruple, which arose not so much from a superiority
  of reason, as from a want of ingenuity. The only temples in Germany were
  dark and ancient groves, consecrated by the reverence of succeeding
  generations. Their secret gloom, the imagined residence of an invisible
  power, by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship, impressed the
  mind with a still deeper sense of religious horror; and the priests, rude
  and illiterate as they were, had been taught by experience the use of
  every artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited
  to their own interest.
</p>
<p>
  The same ignorance, which renders barbarians incapable of conceiving or
  embracing the useful restraints of laws, exposes them naked and unarmed to
  the blind terrors of superstition. The German priests, improving this
  favorable temper of their countrymen, had assumed a jurisdiction even in
  temporal concerns, which the magistrate could not venture to exercise; and
  the haughty warrior patiently submitted to the lash of correction, when it
  was inflicted, not by any human power, but by the immediate order of the
  god of war. The defects of civil policy were sometimes supplied by the
  interposition of ecclesiastical authority. The latter was constantly
  exerted to maintain silence and decency in the popular assemblies; and was
  sometimes extended to a more enlarged concern for the national welfare. A
  solemn procession was occasionally celebrated in the present countries of
  Mecklenburgh and Pomerania. The unknown symbol of the <i>Earth</i>,
  covered with a thick veil, was placed on a carriage drawn by cows; and in
  this manner the goddess, whose common residence was in the Isles of Rugen,
  visited several adjacent tribes of her worshippers. During her progress
  the sound of war was hushed, quarrels were suspended, arms laid aside, and
  the restless Germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace
  and harmony. The <i>truce of God</i>, so often and so ineffectually
  proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century, was an obvious imitation
  of this ancient custom.
</p>
<p>
  But the influence of religion was far more powerful to inflame, than to
  moderate, the fierce passions of the Germans. Interest and fanaticism
  often prompted its ministers to sanctify the most daring and the most
  unjust enterprises, by the approbation of Heaven, and full assurances of
  success. The consecrated standards, long revered in the groves of
  superstition, were placed in the front of the battle; and the hostile army
  was devoted with dire execrations to the gods of war and of thunder. In
  the faith of soldiers (and such were the Germans) cowardice is the most
  unpardonable of sins. A brave man was the worthy favorite of their martial
  deities; the wretch who had lost his shield was alike banished from the
  religious and civil assemblies of his countrymen. Some tribes of the north
  seem to have embraced the doctrine of transmigration, others imagined a
  gross paradise of immortal drunkenness. All agreed that a life spent in
  arms, and a glorious death in battle, were the best preparations for a
  happy futurity, either in this or in another world.
</p>
<p>
  The immortality so vainly promised by the priests, was, in some degree,
  conferred by the bards. That singular order of men has most deservedly
  attracted the notice of all who have attempted to investigate the
  antiquities of the Celts, the Scandinavians, and the Germans. Their genius
  and character, as well as the reverence paid to that important office,
  have been sufficiently illustrated. But we cannot so easily express, or
  even conceive, the enthusiasm of arms and glory which they kindled in the
  breast of their audience. Among a polished people a taste for poetry is
  rather an amusement of the fancy than a passion of the soul. And yet,
  when in calm retirement we peruse the combats described by Homer or Tasso,
  we are insensibly seduced by the fiction, and feel a momentary glow of
  martial ardor. But how faint, how cold is the sensation which a peaceful
  mind can receive from solitary study! It was in the hour of battle, or in
  the feast of victory, that the bards celebrated the glory of the heroes of
  ancient days, the ancestors of those warlike chieftains, who listened with
  transport to their artless but animated strains. The view of arms and of
  danger heightened the effect of the military song; and the passions which
  it tended to excite, the desire of fame, and the contempt of death, were
  the habitual sentiments of a German mind. *
</p>
<p>
  Such was the situation, and such were the manners of the ancient Germans.
  Their climate, their want of learning, of arts, and of laws, their notions
  of honor, of gallantry, and of religion, their sense of freedom,
  impatience of peace, and thirst of enterprise, all contributed to form a
  people of military heroes. And yet we find, that during more than two
  hundred and fifty years that elapsed from the defeat of Varus to the reign
  of Decius, these formidable barbarians made few considerable attempts, and
  not any material impression on the luxurious, and enslaved provinces of the
  empire. Their progress was checked by their want of arms and discipline,
  and their fury was diverted by the intestine divisions of ancient Germany.
</p>
<p>
  I. It has been observed, with ingenuity, and not without truth, that the
  command of iron soon gives a nation the command of gold. But the rude
  tribes of Germany, alike destitute of both those valuable metals, were
  reduced slowly to acquire, by their unassisted strength, the possession of
  the one as well as the other. The face of a German army displayed their
  poverty of iron. Swords, and the longer kind of lances, they could seldom
  use. Their frame (as they called them in their own language) were long
  spears headed with a sharp but narrow iron point, and which, as occasion
  required, they either darted from a distance, or pushed in close onset.
  With this spear, and with a shield, their cavalry was contented. A
  multitude of darts, scattered with incredible force, were an additional
  resource of the infantry. Their military dress, when they wore any, was
  nothing more than a loose mantle. A variety of colors was the only
  ornament of their wooden or osier shields. Few of the chiefs were
  distinguished by cuirasses, scarcely any by helmets. Though the horses of
  Germany were neither beautiful, swift, nor practised in the skilful
  evolutions of the Roman manege, several of the nations obtained renown by
  their cavalry; but, in general, the principal strength of the Germans
  consisted in their infantry, which was drawn up in several deep columns,
  according to the distinction of tribes and families. Impatient of fatigue
  and delay, these half-armed warriors rushed to battle with dissonant
  shouts and disordered ranks; and sometimes, by the effort of native valor,
  prevailed over the constrained and more artificial bravery of the Roman
  mercenaries. But as the barbarians poured forth their whole souls on the
  first onset, they knew not how to rally or to retire. A repulse was a sure
  defeat; and a defeat was most commonly total destruction. When we
  recollect the complete armor of the Roman soldiers, their discipline,
  exercises, evolutions, fortified camps, and military engines, it appears a
  just matter of surprise, how the naked and unassisted valor of the
  barbarians could dare to encounter, in the field, the strength of the
  legions, and the various troops of the auxiliaries, which seconded their
  operations. The contest was too unequal, till the introduction of luxury
  had enervated the vigor, and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had
  relaxed the discipline, of the Roman armies. The introduction of barbarian
  auxiliaries into those armies, was a measure attended with very obvious
  dangers, as it might gradually instruct the Germans in the arts of war and
  of policy. Although they were admitted in small numbers and with the
  strictest precaution, the example of Civilis was proper to convince the
  Romans, that the danger was not imaginary, and that their precautions were
  not always sufficient. During the civil wars that followed the death of
  Nero, that artful and intrepid Batavian, whom his enemies condescended to
  compare with Hannibal and Sertorius, formed a great design of freedom and
  ambition. Eight Batavian cohorts renowned in the wars of Britain and
  Italy, repaired to his standard. He introduced an army of Germans into
  Gaul, prevailed on the powerful cities of Treves and Langres to embrace
  his cause, defeated the legions, destroyed their fortified camps, and
  employed against the Romans the military knowledge which he had acquired
  in their service. When at length, after an obstinate struggle, he yielded
  to the power of the empire, Civilis secured himself and his country by an
  honorable treaty. The Batavians still continued to occupy the islands of
  the Rhine, the allies, not the servants, of the Roman monarchy.
</p>
<p>
  II. The strength of ancient Germany appears formidable, when we consider
  the effects that might have been produced by its united effort. The wide
  extent of country might very possibly contain a million of warriors, as
  all who were of age to bear arms were of a temper to use them. But this
  fierce multitude, incapable of concerting or executing any plan of
  national greatness, was agitated by various and often hostile intentions.
  Germany was divided into more than forty independent states; and, even in
  each state, the union of the several tribes was extremely loose and
  precarious. The barbarians were easily provoked; they knew not how to
  forgive an injury, much less an insult; their resentments were bloody and
  implacable. The casual disputes that so frequently happened in their
  tumultuous parties of hunting or drinking were sufficient to inflame the
  minds of whole nations; the private feuds of any considerable chieftains
  diffused itself among their followers and allies. To chastise the
  insolent, or to plunder the defenceless, were alike causes of war. The
  most formidable states of Germany affected to encompass their territories
  with a wide frontier of solitude and devastation. The awful distance
  preserved by their neighbors attested the terror of their arms, and in
  some measure defended them from the danger of unexpected incursions.
</p>
<p>
  “The Bructeri * (it is Tacitus who now speaks) were totally exterminated
  by the neighboring tribes, provoked by their insolence, allured by the
  hopes of spoil, and perhaps inspired by the tutelar deities of the empire.
  Above sixty thousand barbarians were destroyed; not by the Roman arms, but
  in our sight, and for our entertainment. May the nations, enemies of Rome,
  ever preserve this enmity to each other! We have now attained the utmost
  verge of prosperity, and have nothing left to demand of fortune, except
  the discord of the barbarians.”—These sentiments, less worthy of the
  humanity than of the patriotism of Tacitus, express the invariable maxims
  of the policy of his countrymen. They deemed it a much safer expedient to
  divide than to combat the barbarians, from whose defeat they could derive
  neither honor nor advantage. The money and negotiations of Rome insinuated
  themselves into the heart of Germany; and every art of seduction was used
  with dignity, to conciliate those nations whom their proximity to the
  Rhine or Danube might render the most useful friends as well as the most
  troublesome enemies. Chiefs of renown and power were flattered by the most
  trifling presents, which they received either as marks of distinction, or
  as the instruments of luxury. In civil dissensions the weaker faction
  endeavored to strengthen its interest by entering into secret connections
  with the governors of the frontier provinces. Every quarrel among the
  Germans was fomented by the intrigues of Rome; and every plan of union and
  public good was defeated by the stronger bias of private jealousy and
  interest.
</p>
<p>
  The general conspiracy which terrified the Romans under the reign of
  Marcus Antoninus, comprehended almost all the nations of Germany, and even
  Sarmatia, from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. It is
  impossible for us to determine whether this hasty confederation was formed
  by necessity, by reason, or by passion; but we may rest assured, that the
  barbarians were neither allured by the indolence, nor provoked by the
  ambition, of the Roman monarch. This dangerous invasion required all the
  firmness and vigilance of Marcus. He fixed generals of ability in the
  several stations of attack, and assumed in person the conduct of the most
  important province on the Upper Danube. After a long and doubtful
  conflict, the spirit of the barbarians was subdued. The Quadi and the
  Marcomanni, who had taken the lead in the war, were the most severely
  punished in its catastrophe. They were commanded to retire five miles from
  their own banks of the Danube, and to deliver up the flower of the youth,
  who were immediately sent into Britain, a remote island, where they might
  be secure as hostages, and useful as soldiers. On the frequent rebellions
  of the Quadi and Marcomanni, the irritated emperor resolved to reduce
  their country into the form of a province. His designs were disappointed
  by death. This formidable league, however, the only one that appears in
  the two first centuries of the Imperial history, was entirely dissipated,
  without leaving any traces behind in Germany.
</p>
<p>
  In the course of this introductory chapter, we have confined ourselves to
  the general outlines of the manners of Germany, without attempting to
  describe or to distinguish the various tribes which filled that great
  country in the time of Cæsar, of Tacitus, or of Ptolemy. As the
  ancient, or as new tribes successively present themselves in the series of
  this history, we shall concisely mention their origin, their situation,
  and their particular character. Modern nations are fixed and permanent
  societies, connected among themselves by laws and government, bound to
  their native soil by art and agriculture. The German tribes were
  voluntary and fluctuating associations of soldiers, almost of savages. The
  same territory often changed its inhabitants in the tide of conquest and
  emigration. The same communities, uniting in a plan of defence or
  invasion, bestowed a new title on their new confederacy. The dissolution
  of an ancient confederacy restored to the independent tribes their
  peculiar but long-forgotten appellation. A victorious state often
  communicated its own name to a vanquished people. Sometimes crowds of
  volunteers flocked from all parts to the standard of a favorite leader;
  his camp became their country, and some circumstance of the enterprise
  soon gave a common denomination to the mixed multitude. The distinctions
  of the ferocious invaders were perpetually varied by themselves, and
  confounded by the astonished subjects of the Roman empire.
</p>
<p>
  Wars, and the administration of public affairs, are the principal subjects
  of history; but the number of persons interested in these busy scenes is
  very different, according to the different condition of mankind. In great
  monarchies, millions of obedient subjects pursue their useful occupations
  in peace and obscurity. The attention of the writer, as well as of the
  reader, is solely confined to a court, a capital, a regular army, and the
  districts which happen to be the occasional scene of military operations.
  But a state of freedom and barbarism, the season of civil commotions, or
  the situation of petty republics, raises almost every member of the
  community into action, and consequently into notice. The irregular
  divisions, and the restless motions, of the people of Germany, dazzle our
  imagination, and seem to multiply their numbers. The profuse enumeration
  of kings, of warriors, of armies and nations, inclines us to forget that
  the same objects are continually repeated under a variety of appellations,
  and that the most splendid appellations have been frequently lavished on
  the most inconsiderable objects.

<pre>The Emperors Decius, Gallus, Æmilianus, Valerian, And
Gallienus.—The General Irruption Of The Barbarians.—The
Thirty Tyrants.
</pre>
<p>
  From the great secular games celebrated by Philip, to the death of the
  emperor Gallienus, there elapsed twenty years of shame and misfortune.
  During that calamitous period, every instant of time was marked, every
  province of the Roman world was afflicted, by barbarous invaders, and
  military tyrants, and the ruined empire seemed to approach the last and
  fatal moment of its dissolution. The confusion of the times, and the
  scarcity of authentic memorials, oppose equal difficulties to the
  historian, who attempts to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of
  narration. Surrounded with imperfect fragments, always concise, often
  obscure, and sometimes contradictory, he is reduced to collect, to
  compare, and to conjecture: and though he ought never to place his
  conjectures in the rank of facts, yet the knowledge of human nature, and
  of the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained passions, might, on
  some occasions, supply the want of historical materials.
</p>
<p>
  There is not, for instance, any difficulty in conceiving, that the
  successive murders of so many emperors had loosened all the ties of
  allegiance between the prince and people; that all the generals of Philip
  were disposed to imitate the example of their master; and that the caprice
  of armies, long since habituated to frequent and violent revolutions,
  might every day raise to the throne the most obscure of their
  fellow-soldiers. History can only add, that the rebellion against the
  emperor Philip broke out in the summer of the year two hundred and
  forty-nine, among the legions of Mæsia; and that a subaltern
  officer, named Marinus, was the object of their seditious choice. Philip
  was alarmed. He dreaded lest the treason of the Mæsian army should
  prove the first spark of a general conflagration. Distracted with the
  consciousness of his guilt and of his danger, he communicated the
  intelligence to the senate. A gloomy silence prevailed, the effect of
  fear, and perhaps of disaffection; till at length Decius, one of the
  assembly, assuming a spirit worthy of his noble extraction, ventured to
  discover more intrepidity than the emperor seemed to possess. He treated
  the whole business with contempt, as a hasty and inconsiderate tumult, and
  Philip’s rival as a phantom of royalty, who in a very few days would be
  destroyed by the same inconstancy that had created him. The speedy
  completion of the prophecy inspired Philip with a just esteem for so able
  a counsellor; and Decius appeared to him the only person capable of
  restoring peace and discipline to an army whose tumultuous spirit did not
  immediately subside after the murder of Marinus. Decius, who long resisted
  his own nomination, seems to have insinuated the danger of presenting a
  leader of merit to the angry and apprehensive minds of the soldiers; and
  his prediction was again confirmed by the event. The legions of Mæsia
  forced their judge to become their accomplice. They left him only the
  alternative of death or the purple. His subsequent conduct, after that
  decisive measure, was unavoidable. He conducted, or followed, his army to
  the confines of Italy, whither Philip, collecting all his force to repel
  the formidable competitor whom he had raised up, advanced to meet him. The
  Imperial troops were superior in number; but the rebels formed an army of
  veterans, commanded by an able and experienced leader. Philip was either
  killed in the battle, or put to death a few days afterwards at Verona. His
  son and associate in the empire was massacred at Rome by the Prætorian
  guards; and the victorious Decius, with more favorable circumstances than
  the ambition of that age can usually plead, was universally acknowledged
  by the senate and provinces. It is reported, that, immediately after his
  reluctant acceptance of the title of Augustus, he had assured Philip, by a
  private message, of his innocence and loyalty, solemnly protesting, that,
  on his arrival on Italy, he would resign the Imperial ornaments, and
  return to the condition of an obedient subject. His professions might be
  sincere; but in the situation where fortune had placed him, it was
  scarcely possible that he could either forgive or be forgiven.
</p>
<p>
  The emperor Decius had employed a few months in the works of peace and the
  administration of justice, when he was summoned to the banks of the Danube
  by the invasion of the Goths. This is the first considerable occasion in
  which history mentions that great people, who afterwards broke the Roman
  power, sacked the Capitol, and reigned in Gaul, Spain, and Italy. So
  memorable was the part which they acted in the subversion of the Western
  empire, that the name of Goths is frequently but improperly used as a
  general appellation of rude and warlike barbarism.
</p>
<p>
  In the beginning of the sixth century, and after the conquest of Italy,
  the Goths, in possession of present greatness, very naturally indulged
  themselves in the prospect of past and of future glory. They wished to
  preserve the memory of their ancestors, and to transmit to posterity their
  own achievements.
</p>
<p>
  The principal minister of the court of Ravenna, the learned Cassiodorus,
  gratified the inclination of the conquerors in a Gothic history, which
  consisted of twelve books, now reduced to the imperfect abridgment of
  Jornandes. These writers passed with the most artful conciseness over the
  misfortunes of the nation, celebrated its successful valor, and adorned
  the triumph with many Asiatic trophies, that more properly belonged to the
  people of Scythia. On the faith of ancient songs, the uncertain, but the
  only memorials of barbarians, they deduced the first origin of the Goths
  from the vast island, or peninsula, of Scandinavia. * That extreme country
  of the North was not unknown to the conquerors of Italy: the ties of
  ancient consanguinity had been strengthened by recent offices of
  friendship; and a Scandinavian king had cheerfully abdicated his savage
  greatness, that he might pass the remainder of his days in the peaceful
  and polished court of Ravenna. Many vestiges, which cannot be ascribed to
  the arts of popular vanity, attest the ancient residence of the Goths in
  the countries beyond the Rhine. From the time of the geographer Ptolemy,
  the southern part of Sweden seems to have continued in the possession of
  the less enterprising remnant of the nation, and a large territory is even
  at present divided into east and west Gothland. During the middle ages,
  (from the ninth to the twelfth century,) whilst Christianity was advancing
  with a slow progress into the North, the Goths and the Swedes composed two
  distinct and sometimes hostile members of the same monarchy. The latter of
  these two names has prevailed without extinguishing the former. The
  Swedes, who might well be satisfied with their own fame in arms, have, in
  every age, claimed the kindred glory of the Goths. In a moment of
  discontent against the court of Rome, Charles the Twelfth insinuated, that
  his victorious troops were not degenerated from their brave ancestors, who
  had already subdued the mistress of the world.
</p>
<p>
  Till the end of the eleventh century, a celebrated temple subsisted at
  Upsal, the most considerable town of the Swedes and Goths. It was enriched
  with the gold which the Scandinavians had acquired in their piratical
  adventures, and sanctified by the uncouth representations of the three
  principal deities, the god of war, the goddess of generation, and the god
  of thunder. In the general festival, that was solemnized every ninth year,
  nine animals of every species (without excepting the human) were
  sacrificed, and their bleeding bodies suspended in the sacred grove
  adjacent to the temple. The only traces that now subsist of this barbaric
  superstition are contained in the Edda, * a system of mythology, compiled
  in Iceland about the thirteenth century, and studied by the learned of
  Denmark and Sweden, as the most valuable remains of their ancient
  traditions.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding the mysterious obscurity of the Edda, we can easily
  distinguish two persons confounded under the name of Odin; the god of war,
  and the great legislator of Scandinavia. The latter, the Mahomet of the
  North, instituted a religion adapted to the climate and to the people.
  Numerous tribes on either side of the Baltic were subdued by the
  invincible valor of Odin, by his persuasive eloquence, and by the fame
  which he acquired of a most skilful magician. The faith that he had
  propagated, during a long and prosperous life, he confirmed by a voluntary
  death. Apprehensive of the ignominious approach of disease and infirmity,
  he resolved to expire as became a warrior. In a solemn assembly of the
  Swedes and Goths, he wounded himself in nine mortal places, hastening away
  (as he asserted with his dying voice) to prepare the feast of heroes in
  the palace of the God of war.
</p>
<p>
  The native and proper habitation of Odin is distinguished by the
  appellation of As-gard. The happy resemblance of that name with As-burg,
  or As-of, words of a similar signification, has given rise to an
  historical system of so pleasing a contexture, that we could almost wish
  to persuade ourselves of its truth. It is supposed that Odin was the chief
  of a tribe of barbarians which dwelt on the banks of the Lake Mæotis,
  till the fall of Mithridates and the arms of Pompey menaced the North with
  servitude. That Odin, yielding with indignant fury to a power he was
  unable to resist, conducted his tribe from the frontiers of the Asiatic
  Sarmatia into Sweden, with the great design of forming, in that
  inaccessible retreat of freedom, a religion and a people which, in some
  remote age, might be subservient to his immortal revenge; when his
  invincible Goths, armed with martial fanaticism, should issue in numerous
  swarms from the neighborhood of the Polar circle, to chastise the
  oppressors of mankind.
</p>
<p>
  If so many successive generations of Goths were capable of preserving a
  faint tradition of their Scandinavian origin, we must not expect, from
  such unlettered barbarians, any distinct account of the time and
  circumstances of their emigration. To cross the Baltic was an easy and
  natural attempt. The inhabitants of Sweden were masters of a sufficient
  number of large vessels, with oars, and the distance is little more than
  one hundred miles from Carlscroon to the nearest ports of Pomerania and
  Prussia. Here, at length, we land on firm and historic ground. At least as
  early as the Christian æra, and as late as the age of the Antonines,
  the Goths were established towards the mouth of the Vistula, and in that
  fertile province where the commercial cities of Thorn, Elbing,
  Köningsberg, and Dantzick, were long afterwards founded. Westward of the
  Goths, the numerous tribes of the Vandals were spread along the banks of
  the Oder, and the sea-coast of Pomerania and Mecklenburgh. A striking
  resemblance of manners, complexion, religion, and language, seemed to
  indicate that the Vandals and the Goths were originally one great people.
  The latter appear to have been subdivided into Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and
  Gepidæ. The distinction among the Vandals was more strongly marked
  by the independent names of Heruli, Burgundians, Lombards, and a variety
  of other petty states, many of which, in a future age, expanded themselves
  into powerful monarchies.
</p>
<p>
  In the age of the Antonines, the Goths were still seated in Prussia.
  About the reign of Alexander Severus, the Roman province of Dacia had
  already experienced their proximity by frequent and destructive inroads.
  In this interval, therefore, of about seventy years we must place the
  second migration of the Goths from the Baltic to the Euxine; but the
  cause that produced it lies concealed among the various motives which
  actuate the conduct of unsettled barbarians. Either a pestilence or a
  famine, a victory or a defeat, an oracle of the gods or the eloquence of
  a daring leader, were sufficient to impel the Gothic arms on the milder
  climates of the south. Besides the influence of a martial religion, the
  numbers and spirit of the Goths were equal to the most dangerous
  adventures. The use of round bucklers and short swords rendered them
  formidable in a close engagement; the manly obedience which they yielded
  to hereditary kings, gave uncommon union and stability to their councils;
  and the renowned Amala, the hero of that age, and the tenth ancestor of
  Theodoric, king of Italy, enforced, by the ascendant of personal merit,
  the prerogative of his birth, which he derived from the <i>Anses</i>, or
  demigods of the Gothic nation.
</p>
<p>
  The fame of a great enterprise excited the bravest warriors from all the
  Vandalic states of Germany, many of whom are seen a few years afterwards
  combating under the common standard of the Goths. The first motions of the
  emigrants carried them to the banks of the Prypec, a river universally
  conceived by the ancients to be the southern branch of the Borysthenes.
  The windings of that great stream through the plains of Poland and Russia
  gave a direction to their line of march, and a constant supply of fresh
  water and pasturage to their numerous herds of cattle. They followed the
  unknown course of the river, confident in their valor, and careless of
  whatever power might oppose their progress. The Bastarnæ and the
  Venedi were the first who presented themselves; and the flower of their
  youth, either from choice or compulsion, increased the Gothic army. The
  Bastarnæ dwelt on the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains: the
  immense tract of land that separated the Bastarnæ from the savages
  of Finland was possessed, or rather wasted, by the Venedi; we have some
  reason to believe that the first of these nations, which distinguished
  itself in the Macedonian war, and was afterwards divided into the
  formidable tribes of the Peucini, the Borani, the Carpi, &amp;c., derived
  its origin from the Germans. * With better authority, a Sarmatian
  extraction may be assigned to the Venedi, who rendered themselves so
  famous in the middle ages. But the confusion of blood and manners on that
  doubtful frontier often perplexed the most accurate observers. As the
  Goths advanced near the Euxine Sea, they encountered a purer race of
  Sarmatians, the Jazyges, the Alani, and the Roxolani; and they were
  probably the first Germans who saw the mouths of the Borysthenes, and of
  the Tanais. If we inquire into the characteristic marks of the people of
  Germany and of Sarmatia, we shall discover that those two great portions
  of human kind were principally distinguished by fixed huts or movable
  tents, by a close dress or flowing garments, by the marriage of one or of
  several wives, by a military force, consisting, for the most part, either
  of infantry or cavalry; and above all, by the use of the Teutonic, or of
  the Sclavonian language; the last of which has been diffused by conquest,
  from the confines of Italy to the neighborhood of Japan.

  Chapter X: Emperors Decius, Gallus, Æmilianus, Valerian And
  Gallienus.—Part II.
</h2>
<p>
  The Goths were now in possession of the Ukraine, a country of considerable
  extent and uncommon fertility, intersected with navigable rivers, which,
  from either side, discharge themselves into the Borysthenes; and
  interspersed with large and lofty forests of oaks. The plenty of game and
  fish, the innumerable bee-hives deposited in the hollow of old trees, and
  in the cavities of rocks, and forming, even in that rude age, a valuable
  branch of commerce, the size of the cattle, the temperature of the air,
  the aptness of the soil for every species of grain, and the luxuriancy of
  the vegetation, all displayed the liberality of Nature, and tempted the
  industry of man. But the Goths withstood all these temptations, and still
  adhered to a life of idleness, of poverty, and of rapine.
</p>
<p>
  The Scythian hordes, which, towards the east, bordered on the new
  settlements of the Goths, presented nothing to their arms, except the
  doubtful chance of an unprofitable victory. But the prospect of the Roman
  territories was far more alluring; and the fields of Dacia were covered
  with rich harvests, sown by the hands of an industrious, and exposed to be
  gathered by those of a warlike, people. It is probable that the conquests
  of Trajan, maintained by his successors, less for any real advantage than
  for ideal dignity, had contributed to weaken the empire on that side. The
  new and unsettled province of Dacia was neither strong enough to resist,
  nor rich enough to satiate, the rapaciousness of the barbarians. As long
  as the remote banks of the Niester were considered as the boundary of the
  Roman power, the fortifications of the Lower Danube were more carelessly
  guarded, and the inhabitants of Mæsia lived in supine security,
  fondly conceiving themselves at an inaccessible distance from any
  barbarian invaders. The irruptions of the Goths, under the reign of
  Philip, fatally convinced them of their mistake. The king, or leader, of
  that fierce nation, traversed with contempt the province of Dacia, and
  passed both the Niester and the Danube without encountering any opposition
  capable of retarding his progress. The relaxed discipline of the Roman
  troops betrayed the most important posts, where they were stationed, and
  the fear of deserved punishment induced great numbers of them to enlist
  under the Gothic standard. The various multitude of barbarians appeared,
  at length, under the walls of Marcianopolis, a city built by Trajan in
  honor of his sister, and at that time the capital of the second Mæsia.
  The inhabitants consented to ransom their lives and property by the
  payment of a large sum of money, and the invaders retreated back into
  their deserts, animated, rather than satisfied, with the first success of
  their arms against an opulent but feeble country. Intelligence was soon
  transmitted to the emperor Decius, that Cniva, king of the Goths, had
  passed the Danube a second time, with more considerable forces; that his
  numerous detachments scattered devastation over the province of Mæsia,
  whilst the main body of the army, consisting of seventy thousand Germans
  and Sarmatians, a force equal to the most daring achievements, required
  the presence of the Roman monarch, and the exertion of his military power.
</p>
<p>
  Decius found the Goths engaged before Nicopolis, one of the many monuments
  of Trajan’s victories. On his approach they raised the siege, but with a
  design only of marching away to a conquest of greater importance, the
  siege of Philippopolis, a city of Thrace, founded by the father of
  Alexander, near the foot of Mount Hæmus. Decius followed them
  through a difficult country, and by forced marches; but when he imagined
  himself at a considerable distance from the rear of the Goths, Cniva
  turned with rapid fury on his pursuers. The camp of the Romans was
  surprised and pillaged, and, for the first time, their emperor fled in
  disorder before a troop of half-armed barbarians. After a long resistance,
  Philippopolis, destitute of succor, was taken by storm. A hundred thousand
  persons are reported to have been massacred in the sack of that great
  city. Many prisoners of consequence became a valuable accession to the
  spoil; and Priscus, a brother of the late emperor Philip, blushed not to
  assume the purple, under the protection of the barbarous enemies of Rome.
  The time, however, consumed in that tedious siege, enabled Decius to
  revive the courage, restore the discipline, and recruit the numbers of his
  troops. He intercepted several parties of Carpi, and other Germans, who
  were hastening to share the victory of their countrymen, intrusted the
  passes of the mountains to officers of approved valor and fidelity,
  repaired and strengthened the fortifications of the Danube, and exerted
  his utmost vigilance to oppose either the progress or the retreat of the
  Goths. Encouraged by the return of fortune, he anxiously waited for an
  opportunity to retrieve, by a great and decisive blow, his own glory, and
  that of the Roman arms.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time when Decius was struggling with the violence of the
  tempest, his mind, calm and deliberate amidst the tumult of war,
  investigated the more general causes that, since the age of the
  Antonines, had so impetuously urged the decline of the Roman greatness. He
  soon discovered that it was impossible to replace that greatness on a
  permanent basis without restoring public virtue, ancient principles and
  manners, and the oppressed majesty of the laws. To execute this noble but
  arduous design, he first resolved to revive the obsolete office of censor;
  an office which, as long as it had subsisted in its pristine integrity,
  had so much contributed to the perpetuity of the state, till it was
  usurped and gradually neglected by the Cæsars. Conscious that the
  favor of the sovereign may confer power, but that the esteem of the people
  can alone bestow authority, he submitted the choice of the censor to the
  unbiased voice of the senate. By their unanimous votes, or rather
  acclamations, Valerian, who was afterwards emperor, and who then served
  with distinction in the army of Decius, was declared the most worthy of
  that exalted honor. As soon as the decree of the senate was transmitted to
  the emperor, he assembled a great council in his camp, and before the
  investiture of the censor elect, he apprised him of the difficulty and
  importance of his great office. “Happy Valerian,” said the prince to his
  distinguished subject, “happy in the general approbation of the senate and
  of the Roman republic! Accept the censorship of mankind; and judge of our
  manners. You will select those who deserve to continue members of the
  senate; you will restore the equestrian order to its ancient splendor; you
  will improve the revenue, yet moderate the public burdens. You will
  distinguish into regular classes the various and infinite multitude of
  citizens, and accurately view the military strength, the wealth, the
  virtue, and the resources of Rome. Your decisions shall obtain the force
  of laws. The army, the palace, the ministers of justice, and the great
  officers of the empire, are all subject to your tribunal. None are
  exempted, excepting only the ordinary consuls, the præfect of the
  city, the king of the sacrifices, and (as long as she preserves her
  chastity inviolate) the eldest of the vestal virgins. Even these few, who
  may not dread the severity, will anxiously solicit the esteem, of the
  Roman censor.”
</p>
<p>
  A magistrate, invested with such extensive powers, would have appeared not
  so much the minister, as the colleague of his sovereign. Valerian justly
  dreaded an elevation so full of envy and of suspicion. He modestly argued
  the alarming greatness of the trust, his own insufficiency, and the
  incurable corruption of the times. He artfully insinuated, that the office
  of censor was inseparable from the Imperial dignity, and that the feeble
  hands of a subject were unequal to the support of such an immense weight
  of cares and of power. The approaching event of war soon put an end to the
  prosecution of a project so specious, but so impracticable; and whilst it
  preserved Valerian from the danger, saved the emperor Decius from the
  disappointment, which would most probably have attended it. A censor may
  maintain, he can never restore, the morals of a state. It is impossible
  for such a magistrate to exert his authority with benefit, or even with
  effect, unless he is supported by a quick sense of honor and virtue in the
  minds of the people, by a decent reverence for the public opinion, and by
  a train of useful prejudices combating on the side of national manners. In
  a period when these principles are annihilated, the censorial jurisdiction
  must either sink into empty pageantry, or be converted into a partial
  instrument of vexatious oppression. It was easier to vanquish the Goths
  than to eradicate the public vices; yet even in the first of these
  enterprises, Decius lost his army and his life.
</p>
<p>
  The Goths were now, on every side, surrounded and pursued by the Roman
  arms. The flower of their troops had perished in the long siege of
  Philippopolis, and the exhausted country could no longer afford
  subsistence for the remaining multitude of licentious barbarians. Reduced
  to this extremity, the Goths would gladly have purchased, by the surrender
  of all their booty and prisoners, the permission of an undisturbed
  retreat. But the emperor, confident of victory, and resolving, by the
  chastisement of these invaders, to strike a salutary terror into the
  nations of the North, refused to listen to any terms of accommodation. The
  high-spirited barbarians preferred death to slavery. An obscure town of Mæsia,
  called Forum Terebronii, was the scene of the battle. The Gothic army was
  drawn up in three lines, and either from choice or accident, the front of
  the third line was covered by a morass. In the beginning of the action,
  the son of Decius, a youth of the fairest hopes, and already associated to
  the honors of the purple, was slain by an arrow, in the sight of his
  afflicted father; who, summoning all his fortitude, admonished the
  dismayed troops, that the loss of a single soldier was of little
  importance to the republic. The conflict was terrible; it was the combat
  of despair against grief and rage. The first line of the Goths at length
  gave way in disorder; the second, advancing to sustain it, shared its
  fate; and the third only remained entire, prepared to dispute the passage
  of the morass, which was imprudently attempted by the presumption of the
  enemy. “Here the fortune of the day turned, and all things became adverse
  to the Romans; the place deep with ooze, sinking under those who stood,
  slippery to such as advanced; their armor heavy, the waters deep; nor
  could they wield, in that uneasy situation, their weighty javelins. The
  barbarians, on the contrary, were inured to encounter in the bogs, their
  persons tall, their spears long, such as could wound at a distance.” In
  this morass the Roman army, after an ineffectual struggle, was
  irrecoverably lost; nor could the body of the emperor ever be found. Such
  was the fate of Decius, in the fiftieth year of his age; an accomplished
  prince, active in war and affable in peace; who, together with his son,
  has deserved to be compared, both in life and death, with the brightest
  examples of ancient virtue.
</p>
<p>
  This fatal blow humbled, for a very little time, the insolence of the
  legions. They appeared to have patiently expected, and submissively
  obeyed, the decree of the senate which regulated the succession to the
  throne. From a just regard for the memory of Decius, the Imperial title
  was conferred on Hostilianus, his only surviving son; but an equal rank,
  with more effectual power, was granted to Gallus, whose experience and
  ability seemed equal to the great trust of guardian to the young prince
  and the distressed empire. The first care of the new emperor was to
  deliver the Illyrian provinces from the intolerable weight of the
  victorious Goths. He consented to leave in their hands the rich fruits of
  their invasion, an immense booty, and what was still more disgraceful, a
  great number of prisoners of the highest merit and quality. He plentifully
  supplied their camp with every conveniency that could assuage their angry
  spirits or facilitate their so much wished-for departure; and he even
  promised to pay them annually a large sum of gold, on condition they
  should never afterwards infest the Roman territories by their incursions.
</p>
<p>
  In the age of the Scipios, the most opulent kings of the earth, who
  courted the protection of the victorious commonwealth, were gratified with
  such trifling presents as could only derive a value from the hand that
  bestowed them; an ivory chair, a coarse garment of purple, an
  inconsiderable piece of plate, or a quantity of copper coin. After the
  wealth of nations had centred in Rome, the emperors displayed their
  greatness, and even their policy, by the regular exercise of a steady and
  moderate liberality towards the allies of the state. They relieved the
  poverty of the barbarians, honored their merit, and recompensed their
  fidelity. These voluntary marks of bounty were understood to flow, not
  from the fears, but merely from the generosity or the gratitude of the
  Romans; and whilst presents and subsidies were liberally distributed among
  friends and suppliants, they were sternly refused to such as claimed them
  as a debt. But this stipulation, of an annual payment to a victorious
  enemy, appeared without disguise in the light of an ignominious tribute;
  the minds of the Romans were not yet accustomed to accept such unequal
  laws from a tribe of barbarians; and the prince, who by a necessary
  concession had probably saved his country, became the object of the
  general contempt and aversion. The death of Hostilianus, though it
  happened in the midst of a raging pestilence, was interpreted as the
  personal crime of Gallus; and even the defeat of the later emperor was
  ascribed by the voice of suspicion to the perfidious counsels of his hated
  successor. The tranquillity which the empire enjoyed during the first year
  of his administration, served rather to inflame than to appease the public
  discontent; and as soon as the apprehensions of war were removed, the
  infamy of the peace was more deeply and more sensibly felt.
</p>
<p>
  But the Romans were irritated to a still higher degree, when they
  discovered that they had not even secured their repose, though at the
  expense of their honor. The dangerous secret of the wealth and weakness of
  the empire had been revealed to the world. New swarms of barbarians,
  encouraged by the success, and not conceiving themselves bound by the
  obligation of their brethren, spread devastation through the Illyrian
  provinces, and terror as far as the gates of Rome. The defence of the
  monarchy, which seemed abandoned by the pusillanimous emperor, was assumed
  by Æmilianus, governor of Pannonia and Mæsia; who rallied the
  scattered forces, and revived the fainting spirits of the troops. The
  barbarians were unexpectedly attacked, routed, chased, and pursued beyond
  the Danube. The victorious leader distributed as a donative the money
  collected for the tribute, and the acclamations of the soldiers proclaimed
  him emperor on the field of battle. Gallus, who, careless of the general
  welfare, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italy, was almost in the
  same instant informed of the success, of the revolt, and of the rapid
  approach of his aspiring lieutenant. He advanced to meet him as far as the
  plains of Spoleto. When the armies came in sight of each other, the
  soldiers of Gallus compared the ignominious conduct of their sovereign
  with the glory of his rival. They admired the valor of Æmilianus;
  they were attracted by his liberality, for he offered a considerable
  increase of pay to all deserters. The murder of Gallus, and of his son
  Volusianus, put an end to the civil war; and the senate gave a legal
  sanction to the rights of conquest. The letters of Æmilianus to that
  assembly displayed a mixture of moderation and vanity. He assured them,
  that he should resign to their wisdom the civil administration; and,
  contenting himself with the quality of their general, would in a short
  time assert the glory of Rome, and deliver the empire from all the
  barbarians both of the North and of the East. His pride was flattered by
  the applause of the senate; and medals are still extant, representing him
  with the name and attributes of Hercules the Victor, and Mars the Avenger.
</p>
<p>
  If the new monarch possessed the abilities, he wanted the time, necessary
  to fulfil these splendid promises. Less than four months intervened
  between his victory and his fall. He had vanquished Gallus: he sunk under
  the weight of a competitor more formidable than Gallus. That unfortunate
  prince had sent Valerian, already distinguished by the honorable title of
  censor, to bring the legions of Gaul and Germany to his aid. Valerian
  executed that commission with zeal and fidelity; and as he arrived too
  late to save his sovereign, he resolved to revenge him. The troops of
  Æmilianus, who still lay encamped in the plains of Spoleto, were
  awed by the sanctity of his character, but much more by the superior
  strength of his army; and as they were now become as incapable of personal
  attachment as they had always been of constitutional principle, they
  readily imbrued their hands in the blood of a prince who so lately had
  been the object of their partial choice. The guilt was theirs, * but the
  advantage of it was Valerian’s; who obtained the possession of the throne
  by the means indeed of a civil war, but with a degree of innocence
  singular in that age of revolutions; since he owed neither gratitude nor
  allegiance to his predecessor, whom he dethroned.
</p>
<p>
  Valerian was about sixty years of age when he was invested with the
  purple, not by the caprice of the populace, or the clamors of the army,
  but by the unanimous voice of the Roman world. In his gradual ascent
  through the honors of the state, he had deserved the favor of virtuous
  princes, and had declared himself the enemy of tyrants. His noble birth,
  his mild but unblemished manners, his learning, prudence, and experience,
  were revered by the senate and people; and if mankind (according to the
  observation of an ancient writer) had been left at liberty to choose a
  master, their choice would most assuredly have fallen on Valerian. Perhaps
  the merit of this emperor was inadequate to his reputation; perhaps his
  abilities, or at least his spirit, were affected by the languor and
  coldness of old age. The consciousness of his decline engaged him to share
  the throne with a younger and more active associate; the emergency of the
  times demanded a general no less than a prince; and the experience of the
  Roman censor might have directed him where to bestow the Imperial purple,
  as the reward of military merit. But instead of making a judicious choice,
  which would have confirmed his reign and endeared his memory, Valerian,
  consulting only the dictates of affection or vanity, immediately invested
  with the supreme honors his son Gallienus, a youth whose effeminate vices
  had been hitherto concealed by the obscurity of a private station. The
  joint government of the father and the son subsisted about seven, and the
  sole administration of Gallienus continued about eight, years. But the whole
  period was one uninterrupted series of confusion and calamity. As the
  Roman empire was at the same time, and on every side, attacked by the
  blind fury of foreign invaders, and the wild ambition of domestic
  usurpers, we shall consult order and perspicuity, by pursuing, not so much
  the doubtful arrangement of dates, as the more natural distribution of
  subjects. The most dangerous enemies of Rome, during the reigns of
  Valerian and Gallienus, were, 1. The Franks; 2. The Alemanni; 3. The
  Goths; and, 4. The Persians. Under these general appellations, we may
  comprehend the adventures of less considerable tribes, whose obscure and
  uncouth names would only serve to oppress the memory and perplex the
  attention of the reader.
</p>
<p>
  I. As the posterity of the Franks compose one of the greatest and most
  enlightened nations of Europe, the powers of learning and ingenuity have
  been exhausted in the discovery of their unlettered ancestors. To the
  tales of credulity have succeeded the systems of fancy. Every passage has
  been sifted, every spot has been surveyed, that might possibly reveal some
  faint traces of their origin. It has been supposed that Pannonia, that
  Gaul, that the northern parts of Germany, gave birth to that celebrated
  colony of warriors. At length the most rational critics, rejecting the
  fictitious emigrations of ideal conquerors, have acquiesced in a sentiment
  whose simplicity persuades us of its truth. They suppose, that about the
  year two hundred and forty, a new confederacy was formed under the name of
  Franks, by the old inhabitants of the Lower Rhine and the Weser. * The
  present circle of Westphalia, the Landgraviate of Hesse, and the duchies
  of Brunswick and Luneburg, were the ancient seat of the Chauci, who, in their
  inaccessible morasses, defied the Roman arms; of the Cherusci, proud of
  the fame of Arminius; of the Catti, formidable by their firm and intrepid
  infantry; and of several other tribes of inferior power and renown. The
  love of liberty was the ruling passion of these Germans; the enjoyment of
  it their best treasure; the word that expressed that enjoyment the most
  pleasing to their ear. They deserved, they assumed, they maintained the
  honorable epithet of Franks, or Freemen; which concealed, though it
  did not extinguish, the peculiar names of the several states of the
  confederacy. Tacit consent, and mutual advantage, dictated the first laws
  of the union; it was gradually cemented by habit and experience. The
  league of the Franks may admit of some comparison with the Helvetic body;
  in which every canton, retaining its independent sovereignty, consults
  with its brethren in the common cause, without acknowledging the authority
  of any supreme head or representative assembly. But the principle of the
  two confederacies was extremely different. A peace of two hundred years
  has rewarded the wise and honest policy of the Swiss. An inconstant
  spirit, the thirst of rapine, and a disregard to the most solemn treaties,
  disgraced the character of the Franks.

<h2>
  Chapter X: Emperors Decius, Gallus, Æmilianus, Valerian And
  Gallienus.—Part III.
</h2>
<p>
  The Romans had long experienced the daring valor of the people of Lower
  Germany. The union of their strength threatened Gaul with a more
  formidable invasion, and required the presence of Gallienus, the heir and
  colleague of Imperial power. Whilst that prince, and his infant son
  Salonius, displayed, in the court of Treves, the majesty of the empire, its
  armies were ably conducted by their general, Posthumus, who, though he
  afterwards betrayed the family of Valerian, was ever faithful to the great
  interests of the monarchy. The treacherous language of panegyrics and
  medals darkly announces a long series of victories. Trophies and titles
  attest (if such evidence can attest) the fame of Posthumus, who is
  repeatedly styled the Conqueror of the Germans, and the Savior of Gaul.
</p>
<p>
  But a single fact, the only one indeed of which we have any distinct
  knowledge, erases, in a great measure, these monuments of vanity and
  adulation. The Rhine, though dignified with the title of Safeguard of the
  provinces, was an imperfect barrier against the daring spirit of
  enterprise with which the Franks were actuated. Their rapid devastations
  stretched from the river to the foot of the Pyrenees; nor were they
  stopped by those mountains. Spain, which had never dreaded, was unable to
  resist, the inroads of the Germans. During twelve years, the greatest part
  of the reign of Gallienus, that opulent country was the theatre of
  unequal and destructive hostilities. Tarragona, the flourishing capital of
  a peaceful province, was sacked and almost destroyed; and so late as the
  days of Orosius, who wrote in the fifth century, wretched cottages,
  scattered amidst the ruins of magnificent cities, still recorded the rage
  of the barbarians. When the exhausted country no longer supplied a variety
  of plunder, the Franks seized on some vessels in the ports of Spain, and
  transported themselves into Mauritania. The distant province was
  astonished with the fury of these barbarians, who seemed to fall from a
  new world, as their name, manners, and complexion, were equally unknown on
  the coast of Africa.
</p>
<p>
  II. In that part of Upper Saxony, beyond the Elbe, which is at present
  called the Marquisate of Lusace, there existed, in ancient times, a sacred
  wood, the awful seat of the superstition of the Suevi. None were permitted
  to enter the holy precincts, without confessing, by their servile bonds
  and suppliant posture, the immediate presence of the sovereign Deity.
  Patriotism contributed, as well as devotion, to consecrate the Sonnenwald,
  or wood of the Semnones. It was universally believed, that the nation had
  received its first existence on that sacred spot. At stated periods, the
  numerous tribes who gloried in the Suevic blood, resorted thither by their
  ambassadors; and the memory of their common extraction was perpetrated by
  barbaric rites and human sacrifices. The wide-extended name of Suevi
  filled the interior countries of Germany, from the banks of the Oder to
  those of the Danube. They were distinguished from the other Germans by
  their peculiar mode of dressing their long hair, which they gathered into
  a rude knot on the crown of the head; and they delighted in an ornament
  that showed their ranks more lofty and terrible in the eyes of the enemy.
  Jealous as the Germans were of military renown, they all confessed the
  superior valor of the Suevi; and the tribes of the Usipetes and Tencteri,
  who, with a vast army, encountered the dictator Cæsar, declared that
  they esteemed it not a disgrace to have fled before a people to whose arms
  the immortal gods themselves were unequal.
</p>
<p>
  In the reign of the emperor Caracalla, an innumerable swarm of Suevi
  appeared on the banks of the Main, and in the neighborhood of the Roman
  provinces, in quest either of food, of plunder, or of glory. The hasty
  army of volunteers gradually coalesced into a great and permanent nation,
  and, as it was composed from so many different tribes, assumed the name of
  Alemanni, * or <i>Allmen</i>, to denote at once their various lineage
  and their common bravery. The latter was soon felt by the Romans in many a
  hostile inroad. The Alemanni fought chiefly on horseback; but their
  cavalry was rendered still more formidable by a mixture of light infantry,
  selected from the bravest and most active of the youth, whom frequent
  exercise had inured to accompany the horsemen in the longest march, the
  most rapid charge, or the most precipitate retreat.
</p>
<p>
  This warlike people of Germans had been astonished by the immense
  preparations of Alexander Severus; they were dismayed by the arms of his
  successor, a barbarian equal in valor and fierceness to themselves. But
  still hovering on the frontiers of the empire, they increased the general
  disorder that ensued after the death of Decius. They inflicted severe
  wounds on the rich provinces of Gaul; they were the first who removed the
  veil that covered the feeble majesty of Italy. A numerous body of the
  Alemanni penetrated across the Danube and through the Rhætian Alps
  into the plains of Lombardy, advanced as far as Ravenna, and displayed the
  victorious banners of barbarians almost in sight of Rome.
</p>
<p>
  The insult and the danger rekindled in the senate some sparks of their
  ancient virtue. Both the emperors were engaged in far distant wars,
  Valerian in the East, and Gallienus on the Rhine. All the hopes and
  resources of the Romans were in themselves. In this emergency, the
  senators resumed the defence of the republic, drew out the Prætorian
  guards, who had been left to garrison the capital, and filled up their
  numbers, by enlisting into the public service the stoutest and most
  willing of the Plebeians. The Alemanni, astonished with the sudden
  appearance of an army more numerous than their own, retired into Germany,
  laden with spoil; and their retreat was esteemed as a victory by the
  unwarlike Romans.
</p>
<p>
  When Gallienus received the intelligence that his capital was delivered
  from the barbarians, he was much less delighted than alarmed with the
  courage of the senate, since it might one day prompt them to rescue the
  public from domestic tyranny as well as from foreign invasion. His timid
  ingratitude was published to his subjects, in an edict which prohibited
  the senators from exercising any military employment, and even from
  approaching the camps of the legions. But his fears were groundless. The
  rich and luxurious nobles, sinking into their natural character, accepted,
  as a favor, this disgraceful exemption from military service; and as long
  as they were indulged in the enjoyment of their baths, their theatres, and
  their villas, they cheerfully resigned the more dangerous cares of empire
  to the rough hands of peasants and soldiers.
</p>
<p>
  Another invasion of the Alemanni, of a more formidable aspect, but more
  glorious event, is mentioned by a writer of the lower empire. Three
  hundred thousand are said to have been vanquished, in a battle near Milan,
  by Gallienus in person, at the head of only ten thousand Romans. We may,
  however, with great probability, ascribe this incredible victory either to
  the credulity of the historian, or to some exaggerated exploits of one of
  the emperor’s lieutenants. It was by arms of a very different nature, that
  Gallienus endeavored to protect Italy from the fury of the Germans. He
  espoused Pipa, the daughter of a king of the Marcomanni, a Suevic tribe,
  which was often confounded with the Alemanni in their wars and conquests.
  To the father, as the price of his alliance, he granted an ample
  settlement in Pannonia. The native charms of unpolished beauty seem to
  have fixed the daughter in the affections of the inconstant emperor, and
  the bands of policy were more firmly connected by those of love. But the
  haughty prejudice of Rome still refused the name of marriage to the
  profane mixture of a citizen and a barbarian; and has stigmatized the
  German princess with the opprobrious title of concubine of Gallienus.
</p>
<p>
  III. We have already traced the emigration of the Goths from Scandinavia,
  or at least from Prussia, to the mouth of the Borysthenes, and have
  followed their victorious arms from the Borysthenes to the Danube. Under
  the reigns of Valerian and Gallienus, the frontier of the last-mentioned
  river was perpetually infested by the inroads of Germans and Sarmatians;
  but it was defended by the Romans with more than usual firmness and
  success. The provinces that were the seat of war, recruited the armies of
  Rome with an inexhaustible supply of hardy soldiers; and more than one of
  these Illyrian peasants attained the station, and displayed the abilities,
  of a general. Though flying parties of the barbarians, who incessantly
  hovered on the banks of the Danube, penetrated sometimes to the confines
  of Italy and Macedonia, their progress was commonly checked, or their
  return intercepted, by the Imperial lieutenants. But the great stream of
  the Gothic hostilities was diverted into a very different channel. The
  Goths, in their new settlement of the Ukraine, soon became masters of the
  northern coast of the Euxine: to the south of that inland sea were
  situated the soft and wealthy provinces of Asia Minor, which possessed all
  that could attract, and nothing that could resist, a barbarian conqueror.
</p>
<p>
  The banks of the Borysthenes are only sixty miles distant from the narrow
  entrance of the peninsula of Crim Tartary, known to the ancients under the
  name of Chersonesus Taurica. On that inhospitable shore, Euripides,
  embellishing with exquisite art the tales of antiquity, has placed the
  scene of one of his most affecting tragedies. The bloody sacrifices of
  Diana, the arrival of Orestes and Pylades, and the triumph of virtue and
  religion over savage fierceness, serve to represent an historical truth,
  that the Tauri, the original inhabitants of the peninsula, were, in some
  degree, reclaimed from their brutal manners by a gradual intercourse with
  the Grecian colonies, which settled along the maritime coast. The little
  kingdom of Bosphorus, whose capital was situated on the Straits, through
  which the Mæotis communicates itself to the Euxine, was composed of
  degenerate Greeks and half-civilized barbarians. It subsisted, as an
  independent state, from the time of the Peloponnesian war, was at last
  swallowed up by the ambition of Mithridates, and, with the rest of his
  dominions, sunk under the weight of the Roman arms. From the reign of
  Augustus, the kings of Bosphorus were the humble, but not useless, allies
  of the empire. By presents, by arms, and by a slight fortification drawn
  across the Isthmus, they effectually guarded, against the roving plunderers
  of Sarmatia, the access of a country which, from its peculiar situation
  and convenient harbors, commanded the Euxine Sea and Asia Minor. As long
  as the sceptre was possessed by a lineal succession of kings, they
  acquitted themselves of their important charge with vigilance and success.
  Domestic factions, and the fears, or private interest, of obscure
  usurpers, who seized on the vacant throne, admitted the Goths into the
  heart of Bosphorus. With the acquisition of a superfluous waste of fertile
  soil, the conquerors obtained the command of a naval force, sufficient to
  transport their armies to the coast of Asia. This ships used in the
  navigation of the Euxine were of a very singular construction. They were
  slight flat-bottomed barks framed of timber only, without the least
  mixture of iron, and occasionally covered with a shelving roof, on the
  appearance of a tempest. In these floating houses, the Goths carelessly
  trusted themselves to the mercy of an unknown sea, under the conduct of
  sailors pressed into the service, and whose skill and fidelity were
  equally suspicious. But the hopes of plunder had banished every idea of
  danger, and a natural fearlessness of temper supplied in their minds the
  more rational confidence, which is the just result of knowledge and
  experience. Warriors of such a daring spirit must have often murmured
  against the cowardice of their guides, who required the strongest
  assurances of a settled calm before they would venture to embark; and
  would scarcely ever be tempted to lose sight of the land. Such, at least,
  is the practice of the modern Turks; and they are probably not inferior,
  in the art of navigation, to the ancient inhabitants of Bosphorus.
</p>
<p>
  The fleet of the Goths, leaving the coast of Circassia on the left hand,
  first appeared before Pityus, the utmost limits of the Roman provinces; a
  city provided with a convenient port, and fortified with a strong wall.
  Here they met with a resistance more obstinate than they had reason to
  expect from the feeble garrison of a distant fortress. They were repulsed;
  and their disappointment seemed to diminish the terror of the Gothic name.
  As long as Successianus, an officer of superior rank and merit, defended
  that frontier, all their efforts were ineffectual; but as soon as he was
  removed by Valerian to a more honorable but less important station, they
  resumed the attack of Pityus; and by the destruction of that city,
  obliterated the memory of their former disgrace.
</p>
<p>
  Circling round the eastern extremity of the Euxine Sea, the navigation
  from Pityus to Trebizond is about three hundred miles. The course of the
  Goths carried them in sight of the country of Colchis, so famous by the
  expedition of the Argonauts; and they even attempted, though without
  success, to pillage a rich temple at the mouth of the River Phasis.
  Trebizond, celebrated in the retreat of the ten thousand as an ancient
  colony of Greeks, derived its wealth and splendor from the magnificence of
  the emperor Hadrian, who had constructed an artificial port on a coast
  left destitute by nature of secure harbors. The city was large and
  populous; a double enclosure of walls seemed to defy the fury of the
  Goths, and the usual garrison had been strengthened by a reënforcement of
  ten thousand men. But there are not any advantages capable of supplying
  the absence of discipline and vigilance. The numerous garrison of
  Trebizond, dissolved in riot and luxury, disdained to guard their
  impregnable fortifications. The Goths soon discovered the supine
  negligence of the besieged, erected a lofty pile of fascines, ascended the
  walls in the silence of the night, and entered the defenceless city sword
  in hand. A general massacre of the people ensued, whilst the affrighted
  soldiers escaped through the opposite gates of the town. The most holy
  temples, and the most splendid edifices, were involved in a common
  destruction. The booty that fell into the hands of the Goths was immense:
  the wealth of the adjacent countries had been deposited in Trebizond, as
  in a secure place of refuge. The number of captives was incredible, as the
  victorious barbarians ranged without opposition through the extensive
  province of Pontus. The rich spoils of Trebizond filled a great fleet of
  ships that had been found in the port. The robust youth of the sea-coast
  were chained to the oar; and the Goths, satisfied with the success of
  their first naval expedition, returned in triumph to their new
  establishment in the kingdom of Bosphorus.
</p>
<p>
  The second expedition of the Goths was undertaken with greater powers of
  men and ships; but they steered a different course, and, disdaining the
  exhausted provinces of Pontus, followed the western coast of the Euxine,
  passed before the wide mouths of the Borysthenes, the Niester, and the
  Danube, and increasing their fleet by the capture of a great number of
  fishing barks, they approached the narrow outlet through which the Euxine
  Sea pours its waters into the Mediterranean, and divides the continents of
  Europe and Asia. The garrison of Chalcedon was encamped near the temple of
  Jupiter Urius, on a promontory that commanded the entrance of the Strait;
  and so inconsiderable were the dreaded invasions of the barbarians that
  this body of troops surpassed in number the Gothic army. But it was in
  numbers alone that they surpassed it. They deserted with precipitation
  their advantageous post, and abandoned the town of Chalcedon, most
  plentifully stored with arms and money, to the discretion of the
  conquerors. Whilst they hesitated whether they should prefer the sea or
  land, Europe or Asia, for the scene of their hostilities, a perfidious
  fugitive pointed out Nicomedia, * once the capital of the kings of
  Bithynia, as a rich and easy conquest. He guided the march which was only
  sixty miles from the camp of Chalcedon, directed the resistless attack,
  and partook of the booty; for the Goths had learned sufficient policy to
  reward the traitor whom they detested. Nice, Prusa, Apamæa, Cius,
  cities that had sometimes rivalled, or imitated, the splendor of
  Nicomedia, were involved in the same calamity, which, in a few weeks,
  raged without control through the whole province of Bithynia. Three
  hundred years of peace, enjoyed by the soft inhabitants of Asia, had
  abolished the exercise of arms, and removed the apprehension of danger.
  The ancient walls were suffered to moulder away, and all the revenue of
  the most opulent cities was reserved for the construction of baths,
  temples, and theatres.
</p>
<p>
  When the city of Cyzicus withstood the utmost effort of Mithridates, it
  was distinguished by wise laws, a naval power of two hundred galleys, and
  three arsenals, of arms, of military engines, and of corn. It was still
  the seat of wealth and luxury; but of its ancient strength, nothing
  remained except the situation, in a little island of the Propontis,
  connected with the continent of Asia only by two bridges. From the recent
  sack of Prusa, the Goths advanced within eighteen miles of the city,
  which they had devoted to destruction; but the ruin of Cyzicus was delayed
  by a fortunate accident. The season was rainy, and the Lake Apolloniates,
  the reservoir of all the springs of Mount Olympus, rose to an uncommon
  height. The little river of Rhyndacus, which issues from the lake, swelled
  into a broad and rapid stream, and stopped the progress of the Goths.
  Their retreat to the maritime city of Heraclea, where the fleet had
  probably been stationed, was attended by a long train of wagons, laden
  with the spoils of Bithynia, and was marked by the flames of Nice and
  Nicomedia, which they wantonly burnt. Some obscure hints are mentioned of
  a doubtful combat that secured their retreat. But even a complete victory
  would have been of little moment, as the approach of the autumnal equinox
  summoned them to hasten their return. To navigate the Euxine before the
  month of May, or after that of September, is esteemed by the modern Turks
  the most unquestionable instance of rashness and folly.
</p>
<p>
  When we are informed that the third fleet, equipped by the Goths in the
  ports of Bosphorus, consisted of five hundred sails of ships, our ready
  imagination instantly computes and multiplies the formidable armament;
  but, as we are assured by the judicious Strabo, that the piratical vessels
  used by the barbarians of Pontus and the Lesser Scythia, were not capable
  of containing more than twenty-five or thirty men we may safely affirm,
  that fifteen thousand warriors, at the most, embarked in this great
  expedition. Impatient of the limits of the Euxine, they steered their
  destructive course from the Cimmerian to the Thracian Bosphorus. When they
  had almost gained the middle of the Straits, they were suddenly driven
  back to the entrance of them; till a favorable wind, springing up the next
  day, carried them in a few hours into the placid sea, or rather lake, of
  the Propontis. Their landing on the little island of Cyzicus was attended
  with the ruin of that ancient and noble city. From thence issuing again
  through the narrow passage of the Hellespont, they pursued their winding
  navigation amidst the numerous islands scattered over the Archipelago, or
  the Ægean Sea. The assistance of captives and deserters must have
  been very necessary to pilot their vessels, and to direct their various
  incursions, as well on the coast of Greece as on that of Asia. At length
  the Gothic fleet anchored in the port of Piræus, five miles distant
  from Athens, which had attempted to make some preparations for a vigorous
  defence. Cleodamus, one of the engineers employed by the emperor’s orders
  to fortify the maritime cities against the Goths, had already begun to
  repair the ancient walls, fallen to decay since the time of Scylla. The
  efforts of his skill were ineffectual, and the barbarians became masters
  of the native seat of the muses and the arts. But while the conquerors
  abandoned themselves to the license of plunder and intemperance, their
  fleet, that lay with a slender guard in the harbor of Piræus, was
  unexpectedly attacked by the brave Daxippus, who, flying with the engineer
  Cleodamus from the sack of Athens, collected a hasty band of volunteers,
  peasants as well as soldiers, and in some measure avenged the calamities
  of his country.
</p>
<p>
  But this exploit, whatever lustre it might shed on the declining age of
  Athens, served rather to irritate than to subdue the undaunted spirit of
  the northern invaders. A general conflagration blazed out at the same time
  in every district of Greece. Thebes and Argos, Corinth and Sparta, which
  had formerly waged such memorable wars against each other, were now unable
  to bring an army into the field, or even to defend their ruined
  fortifications. The rage of war, both by land and by sea, spread from the
  eastern point of Sunium to the western coast of Epirus. The Goths had
  already advanced within sight of Italy, when the approach of such imminent
  danger awakened the indolent Gallienus from his dream of pleasure. The
  emperor appeared in arms; and his presence seems to have checked the
  ardor, and to have divided the strength, of the enemy. Naulobatus, a chief
  of the Heruli, accepted an honorable capitulation, entered with a large
  body of his countrymen into the service of Rome, and was invested with the
  ornaments of the consular dignity, which had never before been profaned by
  the hands of a barbarian. Great numbers of the Goths, disgusted with the
  perils and hardships of a tedious voyage, broke into Mæsia, with a
  design of forcing their way over the Danube to their settlements in the
  Ukraine. The wild attempt would have proved inevitable destruction, if the
  discord of the Roman generals had not opened to the barbarians the means
  of an escape. The small remainder of this destroying host returned on
  board their vessels; and measuring back their way through the Hellespont
  and the Bosphorus, ravaged in their passage the shores of Troy, whose
  fame, immortalized by Homer, will probably survive the memory of the
  Gothic conquests. As soon as they found themselves in safety within the
  basin of the Euxine, they landed at Anchialus in Thrace, near the foot of
  Mount Hæmus; and, after all their toils, indulged themselves in the
  use of those pleasant and salutary hot baths. What remained of the voyage
  was a short and easy navigation. Such was the various fate of this third
  and greatest of their naval enterprises. It may seem difficult to conceive
  how the original body of fifteen thousand warriors could sustain the
  losses and divisions of so bold an adventure. But as their numbers were
  gradually wasted by the sword, by shipwrecks, and by the influence of a
  warm climate, they were perpetually renewed by troops of banditti and
  deserters, who flocked to the standard of plunder, and by a crowd of
  fugitive slaves, often of German or Sarmatian extraction, who eagerly
  seized the glorious opportunity of freedom and revenge. In these
  expeditions, the Gothic nation claimed a superior share of honor and
  danger; but the tribes that fought under the Gothic banners are sometimes
  distinguished and sometimes confounded in the imperfect histories of that
  age; and as the barbarian fleets seemed to issue from the mouth of the
  Tanais, the vague but familiar appellation of Scythians was frequently
  bestowed on the mixed multitude.

  Gallienus.—Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
  In the general calamities of mankind, the death of an individual, however
  exalted, the ruin of an edifice, however famous, are passed over with
  careless inattention. Yet we cannot forget that the temple of Diana at
  Ephesus, after having risen with increasing splendor from seven repeated
  misfortunes, was finally burnt by the Goths in their third naval invasion.
  The arts of Greece, and the wealth of Asia, had conspired to erect that
  sacred and magnificent structure. It was supported by a hundred and
  twenty-seven marble columns of the Ionic order. They were the gifts of
  devout monarchs, and each was sixty feet high. The altar was adorned with
  the masterly sculptures of Praxiteles, who had, perhaps, selected from the
  favorite legends of the place the birth of the divine children of Latona,
  the concealment of Apollo after the slaughter of the Cyclops, and the
  clemency of Bacchus to the vanquished Amazons. Yet the length of the
  temple of Ephesus was only four hundred and twenty-five feet, about two
  thirds of the measure of the church of St. Peter’s at Rome. In the other
  dimensions, it was still more inferior to that sublime production of
  modern architecture. The spreading arms of a Christian cross require a
  much greater breadth than the oblong temples of the Pagans; and the
  boldest artists of antiquity would have been startled at the proposal of
  raising in the air a dome of the size and proportions of the Pantheon. The
  temple of Diana was, however, admired as one of the wonders of the world.
  Successive empires, the Persian, the Macedonian, and the Roman, had
  revered its sanctity and enriched its splendor. But the rude savages of
  the Baltic were destitute of a taste for the elegant arts, and they
  despised the ideal terrors of a foreign superstition.
</p>
<p>
  Another circumstance is related of these invasions, which might deserve
  our notice, were it not justly to be suspected as the fanciful conceit of
  a recent sophist. We are told that in the sack of Athens the Goths had
  collected all the libraries, and were on the point of setting fire to this
  funeral pile of Grecian learning, had not one of their chiefs, of more
  refined policy than his brethren, dissuaded them from the design; by the
  profound observation, that as long as the Greeks were addicted to the
  study of books, they would never apply themselves to the exercise of arms.
  The sagacious counsellor (should the truth of the fact be admitted)
  reasoned like an ignorant barbarian. In the most polite and powerful
  nations, genius of every kind has displayed itself about the same period;
  and the age of science has generally been the age of military virtue and
  success.
</p>
<p>
  IV. The new sovereign of Persia, Artaxerxes and his son Sapor, had
  triumphed (as we have already seen) over the house of Arsaces. Of the many
  princes of that ancient race, Chosroes, king of Armenia, had alone
  preserved both his life and his independence. He defended himself by the
  natural strength of his country; by the perpetual resort of fugitives and
  malecontents; by the alliance of the Romans, and above all, by his own
  courage. Invincible in arms, during a thirty years’ war, he was at length
  assassinated by the emissaries of Sapor, king of Persia. The patriotic
  satraps of Armenia, who asserted the freedom and dignity of the crown,
  implored the protection of Rome in favor of Tiridates, the lawful heir.
  But the son of Chosroes was an infant, the allies were at a distance, and
  the Persian monarch advanced towards the frontier at the head of an
  irresistible force. Young Tiridates, the future hope of his country, was
  saved by the fidelity of a servant, and Armenia continued above
  twenty-seven years a reluctant province of the great monarchy of Persia.
  Elated with this easy conquest, and presuming on the distresses or the
  degeneracy of the Romans, Sapor obliged the strong garrisons of Carrhæ
  and Nisibis * to surrender, and spread devastation and terror on either
  side of the Euphrates.
</p>
<p>
  The loss of an important frontier, the ruin of a faithful and natural
  ally, and the rapid success of Sapor’s ambition, affected Rome with a deep
  sense of the insult as well as of the danger. Valerian flattered himself,
  that the vigilance of his lieutenants would sufficiently provide for the
  safety of the Rhine and of the Danube; but he resolved, notwithstanding
  his advanced age, to march in person to the defence of the Euphrates.
  During his progress through Asia Minor, the naval enterprises of the Goths
  were suspended, and the afflicted province enjoyed a transient and
  fallacious calm. He passed the Euphrates, encountered the Persian monarch
  near the walls of Edessa, was vanquished, and taken prisoner by Sapor. The
  particulars of this great event are darkly and imperfectly represented;
  yet, by the glimmering light which is afforded us, we may discover a long
  series of imprudence, of error, and of deserved misfortunes on the side of
  the Roman emperor. He reposed an implicit confidence in Macrianus, his Prætorian
  præfect. That worthless minister rendered his master formidable only
  to the oppressed subjects, and contemptible to the enemies of Rome. By his
  weak or wicked counsels, the Imperial army was betrayed into a situation
  where valor and military skill were equally unavailing. The vigorous
  attempt of the Romans to cut their way through the Persian host was
  repulsed with great slaughter; and Sapor, who encompassed the camp with
  superior numbers, patiently waited till the increasing rage of famine and
  pestilence had insured his victory. The licentious murmurs of the legions
  soon accused Valerian as the cause of their calamities; their seditious
  clamors demanded an instant capitulation. An immense sum of gold was
  offered to purchase the permission of a disgraceful retreat. But the
  Persian, conscious of his superiority, refused the money with disdain; and
  detaining the deputies, advanced in order of battle to the foot of the
  Roman rampart, and insisted on a personal conference with the emperor.
  Valerian was reduced to the necessity of intrusting his life and dignity
  to the faith of an enemy. The interview ended as it was natural to expect.
  The emperor was made a prisoner, and his astonished troops laid down their
  arms. In such a moment of triumph, the pride and policy of Sapor prompted
  him to fill the vacant throne with a successor entirely dependent on his
  pleasure. Cyriades, an obscure fugitive of Antioch, stained with every
  vice, was chosen to dishonor the Roman purple; and the will of the Persian
  victor could not fail of being ratified by the acclamations, however
  reluctant, of the captive army.
</p>
<p>
  The Imperial slave was eager to secure the favor of his master by an act
  of treason to his native country. He conducted Sapor over the Euphrates,
  and, by the way of Chalcis, to the metropolis of the East. So rapid were
  the motions of the Persian cavalry, that, if we may credit a very
  judicious historian, the city of Antioch was surprised when the idle
  multitude was fondly gazing on the amusements of the theatre. The splendid
  buildings of Antioch, private as well as public, were either pillaged or
  destroyed; and the numerous inhabitants were put to the sword, or led away
  into captivity. The tide of devastation was stopped for a moment by the
  resolution of the high priest of Emesa. Arrayed in his sacerdotal robes,
  he appeared at the head of a great body of fanatic peasants, armed only
  with slings, and defended his god and his property from the sacrilegious
  hands of the followers of Zoroaster. But the ruin of Tarsus, and of many
  other cities, furnishes a melancholy proof that, except in this singular
  instance, the conquest of Syria and Cilicia scarcely interrupted the
  progress of the Persian arms. The advantages of the narrow passes of Mount
  Taurus were abandoned, in which an invader, whose principal force
  consisted in his cavalry, would have been engaged in a very unequal
  combat: and Sapor was permitted to form the siege of Cæsarea, the
  capital of Cappadocia; a city, though of the second rank, which was
  supposed to contain four hundred thousand inhabitants. Demosthenes
  commanded in the place, not so much by the commission of the emperor, as
  in the voluntary defence of his country. For a long time he deferred its
  fate; and when at last Cæsarea was betrayed by the perfidy of a
  physician, he cut his way through the Persians, who had been ordered to
  exert their utmost diligence to take him alive. This heroic chief escaped
  the power of a foe who might either have honored or punished his obstinate
  valor; but many thousands of his fellow-citizens were involved in a
  general massacre, and Sapor is accused of treating his prisoners with
  wanton and unrelenting cruelty. Much should undoubtedly be allowed for
  national animosity, much for humbled pride and impotent revenge; yet, upon
  the whole, it is certain, that the same prince, who, in Armenia, had
  displayed the mild aspect of a legislator, showed himself to the Romans
  under the stern features of a conqueror. He despaired of making any
  permanent establishment in the empire, and sought only to leave behind him
  a wasted desert, whilst he transported into Persia the people and the
  treasures of the provinces.
</p>
<p>
  At the time when the East trembled at the name of Sapor, he received a
  present not unworthy of the greatest kings; a long train of camels, laden
  with the most rare and valuable merchandises. The rich offering was
  accompanied with an epistle, respectful, but not servile, from Odenathus,
  one of the noblest and most opulent senators of Palmyra. “Who is this
  Odenathus,” (said the haughty victor, and he commanded that the present
  should be cast into the Euphrates,) “that he thus insolently presumes to
  write to his lord? If he entertains a hope of mitigating his punishment,
  let him fall prostrate before the foot of our throne, with his hands bound
  behind his back. Should he hesitate, swift destruction shall be poured on
  his head, on his whole race, and on his country.” The desperate extremity
  to which the Palmyrenian was reduced, called into action all the latent
  powers of his soul. He met Sapor; but he met him in arms. Infusing his own
  spirit into a little army collected from the villages of Syria and the
  tents of the desert, he hovered round the Persian host, harassed their
  retreat, carried off part of the treasure, and, what was dearer than any
  treasure, several of the women of the great king; who was at last obliged
  to repass the Euphrates with some marks of haste and confusion. By this
  exploit, Odenathus laid the foundations of his future fame and fortunes.
  The majesty of Rome, oppressed by a Persian, was protected by a Syrian or
  Arab of Palmyra.
</p>
<p>
  The voice of history, which is often little more than the organ of hatred
  or flattery, reproaches Sapor with a proud abuse of the rights of
  conquest. We are told that Valerian, in chains, but invested with the
  Imperial purple, was exposed to the multitude, a constant spectacle of
  fallen greatness; and that whenever the Persian monarch mounted on
  horseback, he placed his foot on the neck of a Roman emperor.
  Notwithstanding all the remonstrances of his allies, who repeatedly
  advised him to remember the vicissitudes of fortune, to dread the
  returning power of Rome, and to make his illustrious captive the pledge of
  peace, not the object of insult, Sapor still remained inflexible. When
  Valerian sunk under the weight of shame and grief, his skin, stuffed with
  straw, and formed into the likeness of a human figure, was preserved for
  ages in the most celebrated temple of Persia; a more real monument of
  triumph, than the fancied trophies of brass and marble so often erected by
  Roman vanity. The tale is moral and pathetic, but the truth of it may very
  fairly be called in question. The letters still extant from the princes of
  the East to Sapor are manifest forgeries; nor is it natural to suppose
  that a jealous monarch should, even in the person of a rival, thus
  publicly degrade the majesty of kings. Whatever treatment the unfortunate
  Valerian might experience in Persia, it is at least certain that the only
  emperor of Rome who had ever fallen into the hands of the enemy,
  languished away his life in hopeless captivity.
</p>
<p>
  The emperor Gallienus, who had long supported with impatience the
  censorial severity of his father and colleague, received the intelligence
  of his misfortunes with secret pleasure and avowed indifference. “I knew
  that my father was a mortal,” said he; “and since he has acted as it
  becomes a brave man, I am satisfied.” Whilst Rome lamented the fate of her
  sovereign, the savage coldness of his son was extolled by the servile
  courtiers as the perfect firmness of a hero and a stoic. It is difficult
  to paint the light, the various, the inconstant character of Gallienus,
  which he displayed without constraint, as soon as he became sole possessor
  of the empire. In every art that he attempted, his lively genius enabled
  him to succeed; and as his genius was destitute of judgment, he attempted
  every art, except the important ones of war and government. He was a
  master of several curious, but useless sciences, a ready orator, an
  elegant poet, a skilful gardener, an excellent cook, and most contemptible
  prince. When the great emergencies of the state required his presence and
  attention, he was engaged in conversation with the philosopher Plotinus,
  wasting his time in trifling or licentious pleasures, preparing his
  initiation to the Grecian mysteries, or soliciting a place in the
  Areopagus of Athens. His profuse magnificence insulted the general
  poverty; the solemn ridicule of his triumphs impressed a deeper sense of
  the public disgrace. The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and
  rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with
  affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he
  carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with
  linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul. There were, however, a few
  short moments in the life of Gallienus, when, exasperated by some recent
  injury, he suddenly appeared the intrepid soldier and the cruel tyrant;
  till, satiated with blood, or fatigued by resistance, he insensibly sunk
  into the natural mildness and indolence of his character.
</p>
<p>
  At the time when the reins of government were held with so loose a hand,
  it is not surprising that a crowd of usurpers should start up in every
  province of the empire against the son of Valerian. It was probably some
  ingenious fancy, of comparing the thirty tyrants of Rome with the thirty
  tyrants of Athens, that induced the writers of the Augustan History to
  select that celebrated number, which has been gradually received into a
  popular appellation. But in every light the parallel is idle and
  defective. What resemblance can we discover between a council of thirty
  persons, the united oppressors of a single city, and an uncertain list of
  independent rivals, who rose and fell in irregular succession through the
  extent of a vast empire? Nor can the number of thirty be completed, unless
  we include in the account the women and children who were honored with the
  Imperial title. The reign of Gallienus, distracted as it was, produced
  only nineteen pretenders to the throne: Cyriades, Macrianus, Balista,
  Odenathus, and Zenobia, in the East; in Gaul, and the western provinces,
  Posthumus, Lollianus, Victorinus, and his mother Victoria, Marius, and
  Tetricus; in Illyricum and the confines of the Danube, Ingenuus,
  Regillianus, and Aureolus; in Pontus, Saturninus; in Isauria,
  Trebellianus; Piso in Thessaly; Valens in Achaia; Æmilianus in
  Egypt; and Celsus in Africa. * To illustrate the obscure monuments of the
  life and death of each individual, would prove a laborious task, alike
  barren of instruction and of amusement. We may content ourselves with
  investigating some general characters, that most strongly mark the
  condition of the times, and the manners of the men, their pretensions,
  their motives, their fate, and the destructive consequences of their
  usurpation.
</p>
<p>
  It is sufficiently known, that the odious appellation of <i>Tyrant</i>
  was often employed by the ancients to express the illegal seizure of
  supreme power, without any reference to the abuse of it. Several of the
  pretenders, who raised the standard of rebellion against the emperor
  Gallienus, were shining models of virtue, and almost all possessed a
  considerable share of vigor and ability. Their merit had recommended them
  to the favor of Valerian, and gradually promoted them to the most
  important commands of the empire. The generals, who assumed the title of
  Augustus, were either respected by their troops for their able conduct and
  severe discipline, or admired for valor and success in war, or beloved for
  frankness and generosity. The field of victory was often the scene of
  their election; and even the armorer Marius, the most contemptible of all
  the candidates for the purple, was distinguished, however, by intrepid
  courage, matchless strength, and blunt honesty. His mean and recent trade
  cast, indeed, an air of ridicule on his elevation; * but his birth could
  not be more obscure than was that of the greater part of his rivals, who
  were born of peasants, and enlisted in the army as private soldiers. In
  times of confusion every active genius finds the place assigned him by
  nature: in a general state of war military merit is the road to glory and
  to greatness. Of the nineteen tyrants Tetricus only was a senator; Piso
  alone was a noble. The blood of Numa, through twenty-eight successive
  generations, ran in the veins of Calphurnius Piso, who, by female
  alliances, claimed a right of exhibiting, in his house, the images of
  Crassus and of the great Pompey. His ancestors had been repeatedly
  dignified with all the honors which the commonwealth could bestow; and of
  all the ancient families of Rome, the Calphurnian alone had survived the
  tyranny of the Cæsars. The personal qualities of Piso added new
  lustre to his race. The usurper Valens, by whose order he was killed,
  confessed, with deep remorse, that even an enemy ought to have respected
  the sanctity of Piso; and although he died in arms against Gallienus, the
  senate, with the emperor’s generous permission, decreed the triumphal
  ornaments to the memory of so virtuous a rebel.
</p>
<p>
  The lieutenants of Valerian were grateful to the father, whom they
  esteemed. They disdained to serve the luxurious indolence of his unworthy
  son. The throne of the Roman world was unsupported by any principle of
  loyalty; and treason against such a prince might easily be considered as
  patriotism to the state. Yet if we examine with candor the conduct of
  these usurpers, it will appear, that they were much oftener driven into
  rebellion by their fears, than urged to it by their ambition. They dreaded
  the cruel suspicions of Gallienus; they equally dreaded the capricious
  violence of their troops. If the dangerous favor of the army had
  imprudently declared them deserving of the purple, they were marked for
  sure destruction; and even prudence would counsel them to secure a short
  enjoyment of empire, and rather to try the fortune of war than to expect
  the hand of an executioner. When the clamor of the soldiers invested the
  reluctant victims with the ensigns of sovereign authority, they sometimes
  mourned in secret their approaching fate. “You have lost,” said
  Saturninus, on the day of his elevation, “you have lost a useful
  commander, and you have made a very wretched emperor.”
</p>
<p>
  The apprehensions of Saturninus were justified by the repeated experience
  of revolutions. Of the nineteen tyrants who started up under the reign of
  Gallienus, there was not one who enjoyed a life of peace, or a natural
  death. As soon as they were invested with the bloody purple, they inspired
  their adherents with the same fears and ambition which had occasioned
  their own revolt. Encompassed with domestic conspiracy, military sedition,
  and civil war, they trembled on the edge of precipices, in which, after a
  longer or shorter term of anxiety, they were inevitably lost. These
  precarious monarchs received, however, such honors as the flattery of
  their respective armies and provinces could bestow; but their claim,
  founded on rebellion, could never obtain the sanction of law or history.
  Italy, Rome, and the senate, constantly adhered to the cause of Gallienus,
  and he alone was considered as the sovereign of the empire. That prince
  condescended, indeed, to acknowledge the victorious arms of Odenathus, who
  deserved the honorable distinction, by the respectful conduct which he
  always maintained towards the son of Valerian. With the general applause
  of the Romans, and the consent of Gallienus, the senate conferred the
  title of Augustus on the brave Palmyrenian; and seemed to intrust him with
  the government of the East, which he already possessed, in so independent
  a manner, that, like a private succession, he bequeathed it to his
  illustrious widow, Zenobia.
</p>
<p>
  The rapid and perpetual transitions from the cottage to the throne, and
  from the throne to the grave, might have amused an indifferent
  philosopher; were it possible for a philosopher to remain indifferent
  amidst the general calamities of human kind. The election of these
  precarious emperors, their power and their death, were equally destructive
  to their subjects and adherents. The price of their fatal elevation was
  instantly discharged to the troops by an immense donative, drawn from the
  bowels of the exhausted people. However virtuous was their character,
  however pure their intentions, they found themselves reduced to the hard
  necessity of supporting their usurpation by frequent acts of rapine and
  cruelty. When they fell, they involved armies and provinces in their fall.
  There is still extant a most savage mandate from Gallienus to one of his
  ministers, after the suppression of Ingenuus, who had assumed the purple
  in Illyricum. “It is not enough,” says that soft but inhuman prince, “that
  you exterminate such as have appeared in arms; the chance of battle might
  have served me as effectually. The male sex of every age must be
  extirpated; provided that, in the execution of the children and old men,
  you can contrive means to save our reputation. Let every one die who has
  dropped an expression, who has entertained a thought against me, against
  me, the son of Valerian, the father and brother of so many princes.
  Remember that Ingenuus was made emperor: tear, kill, hew in pieces. I
  write to you with my own hand, and would inspire you with my own
  feelings.” Whilst the public forces of the state were dissipated in
  private quarrels, the defenceless provinces lay exposed to every invader.
  The bravest usurpers were compelled, by the perplexity of their situation,
  to conclude ignominious treaties with the common enemy, to purchase with
  oppressive tributes the neutrality or services of the Barbarians, and to
  introduce hostile and independent nations into the heart of the Roman
  monarchy.
</p>
<p>
  Such were the barbarians, and such the tyrants, who, under the reigns of
  Valerian and Gallienus, dismembered the provinces, and reduced the empire
  to the lowest pitch of disgrace and ruin, from whence it seemed impossible
  that it should ever emerge. As far as the barrenness of materials would
  permit, we have attempted to trace, with order and perspicuity, the
  general events of that calamitous period. There still remain some
  particular facts; I. The disorders of Sicily; II. The tumults of
  Alexandria; and, III. The rebellion of the Isaurians, which may serve to
  reflect a strong light on the horrid picture.
</p>
<p>
  I. Whenever numerous troops of banditti, multiplied by success and
  impunity, publicly defy, instead of eluding, the justice of their country,
  we may safely infer that the excessive weakness of the country is felt
  and abused by the lowest ranks of the community. The situation of Sicily
  preserved it from the Barbarians; nor could the disarmed province have
  supported a usurper. The sufferings of that once flourishing and still
  fertile island were inflicted by baser hands. A licentious crowd of slaves
  and peasants reigned for a while over the plundered country, and renewed
  the memory of the servile wars of more ancient times. Devastations, of
  which the husbandman was either the victim or the accomplice, must have
  ruined the agriculture of Sicily; and as the principal estates were the
  property of the opulent senators of Rome, who often enclosed within a farm
  the territory of an old republic, it is not improbable, that this private
  injury might affect the capital more deeply, than all the conquests of the
  Goths or the Persians.
</p>
<p>
  II. The foundation of Alexandria was a noble design, at once conceived and
  executed by the son of Philip. The beautiful and regular form of that
  great city, second only to Rome itself, comprehended a circumference of
  fifteen miles; it was peopled by three hundred thousand free inhabitants,
  besides at least an equal number of slaves. The lucrative trade of Arabia
  and India flowed through the port of Alexandria, to the capital and
  provinces of the empire. * Idleness was unknown. Some were employed in
  blowing of glass, others in weaving of linen, others again manufacturing
  the papyrus. Either sex, and every age, was engaged in the pursuits of
  industry, nor did even the blind or the lame want occupations suited to
  their condition. But the people of Alexandria, a various mixture of
  nations, united the vanity and inconstancy of the Greeks with the
  superstition and obstinacy of the Egyptians. The most trifling occasion, a
  transient scarcity of flesh or lentils, the neglect of an accustomed
  salutation, a mistake of precedency in the public baths, or even a
  religious dispute, were at any time sufficient to kindle a sedition among
  that vast multitude, whose resentments were furious and implacable. After
  the captivity of Valerian and the insolence of his son had relaxed the
  authority of the laws, the Alexandrians abandoned themselves to the
  ungoverned rage of their passions, and their unhappy country was the
  theatre of a civil war, which continued (with a few short and suspicious
  truces) above twelve years. All intercourse was cut off between the
  several quarters of the afflicted city, every street was polluted with
  blood, every building of strength converted into a citadel; nor did the
  tumults subside till a considerable part of Alexandria was irretrievably
  ruined. The spacious and magnificent district of Bruchion, * with its
  palaces and musæum, the residence of the kings and philosophers of
  Egypt, is described above a century afterwards, as already reduced to its
  present state of dreary solitude.
</p>
<p>
  III. The obscure rebellion of Trebellianus, who assumed the purple in
  Isauria, a petty province of Asia Minor, was attended with strange and
  memorable consequences. The pageant of royalty was soon destroyed by an
  officer of Gallienus; but his followers, despairing of mercy, resolved to
  shake off their allegiance, not only to the emperor, but to the empire,
  and suddenly returned to the savage manners from which they had never
  perfectly been reclaimed. Their craggy rocks, a branch of the
  wide-extended Taurus, protected their inaccessible retreat. The tillage of
  some fertile valleys supplied them with necessaries, and a habit of rapine
  with the luxuries of life. In the heart of the Roman monarchy, the
  Isaurians long continued a nation of wild barbarians. Succeeding princes,
  unable to reduce them to obedience, either by arms or policy, were
  compelled to acknowledge their weakness, by surrounding the hostile and
  independent spot with a strong chain of fortifications, which often proved
  insufficient to restrain the incursions of these domestic foes. The
  Isaurians, gradually extending their territory to the sea-coast, subdued
  the western and mountainous part of Cilicia, formerly the nest of those
  daring pirates, against whom the republic had once been obliged to exert
  its utmost force, under the conduct of the great Pompey.
</p>
<p>
  Our habits of thinking so fondly connect the order of the universe with
  the fate of man, that this gloomy period of history has been decorated
  with inundations, earthquakes, uncommon meteors, preternatural darkness,
  and a crowd of prodigies fictitious or exaggerated. But a long and general
  famine was a calamity of a more serious kind. It was the inevitable
  consequence of rapine and oppression, which extirpated the produce of the
  present and the hope of future harvests. Famine is almost always followed
  by epidemical diseases, the effect of scanty and unwholesome food. Other
  causes must, however, have contributed to the furious plague, which, from
  the year two hundred and fifty to the year two hundred and sixty-five,
  raged without interruption in every province, every city, and almost every
  family, of the Roman empire. During some time five thousand persons died
  daily in Rome; and many towns, that had escaped the hands of the
  Barbarians, were entirely depopulated.
</p>
<p>
  We have the knowledge of a very curious circumstance, of some use perhaps
  in the melancholy calculation of human calamities. An exact register was
  kept at Alexandria of all the citizens entitled to receive the
  distribution of corn. It was found, that the ancient number of those
  comprised between the ages of forty and seventy, had been equal to the
  whole sum of claimants, from fourteen to fourscore years of age, who
  remained alive after the reign of Gallienus. Applying this authentic fact
  to the most correct tables of mortality, it evidently proves, that above
  half the people of Alexandria had perished; and could we venture to extend
  the analogy to the other provinces, we might suspect, that war,
  pestilence, and famine, had consumed, in a few years, the moiety of the
  human species.

  Chapter XI: Reign Of Claudius, Defeat Of The Goths.—Part I.
</h2>
<pre>Reign Of Claudius.—Defeat Of The Goths.—Victories,
Triumph, And Death Of Aurelian.<br>
</pre>
<p>
  Under the deplorable reigns of Valerian and Gallienus, the empire was
  oppressed and almost destroyed by the soldiers, the tyrants, and the
  barbarians. It was saved by a series of great princes, who derived their
  obscure origin from the martial provinces of Illyricum. Within a period of
  about thirty years, Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian and his
  colleagues, triumphed over the foreign and domestic enemies of the state,
  reëstablished, with the military discipline, the strength of the
  frontiers, and deserved the glorious title of Restorers of the Roman
  world.
</p>
<p>
  The removal of an effeminate tyrant made way for a succession of heroes.
  The indignation of the people imputed all their calamities to Gallienus,
  and the far greater part were, indeed, the consequence of his dissolute
  manners and careless administration. He was even destitute of a sense of
  honor, which so frequently supplies the absence of public virtue; and as
  long as he was permitted to enjoy the possession of Italy, a victory of
  the barbarians, the loss of a province, or the rebellion of a general,
  seldom disturbed the tranquil course of his pleasures. At length, a
  considerable army, stationed on the Upper Danube, invested with the
  Imperial purple their leader Aureolus; who, disdaining a confined and
  barren reign over the mountains of Rhætia, passed the Alps, occupied
  Milan, threatened Rome, and challenged Gallienus to dispute in the field
  the sovereignty of Italy. The emperor, provoked by the insult, and alarmed
  by the instant danger, suddenly exerted that latent vigor which sometimes
  broke through the indolence of his temper. Forcing himself from the luxury
  of the palace, he appeared in arms at the head of his legions, and
  advanced beyond the Po to encounter his competitor. The corrupted name of
  Pontirolo still preserves the memory of a bridge over the Adda, which,
  during the action, must have proved an object of the utmost importance to
  both armies. The Rhætian usurper, after receiving a total defeat and
  a dangerous wound, retired into Milan. The siege of that great city was
  immediately formed; the walls were battered with every engine in use among
  the ancients; and Aureolus, doubtful of his internal strength, and
  hopeless of foreign succors already anticipated the fatal consequences of
  unsuccessful rebellion.
</p>
<p>
  His last resource was an attempt to seduce the loyalty of the besiegers.
  He scattered libels through the camp, inviting the troops to desert an
  unworthy master, who sacrificed the public happiness to his luxury, and
  the lives of his most valuable subjects to the slightest suspicions. The
  arts of Aureolus diffused fears and discontent among the principal
  officers of his rival. A conspiracy was formed by Heraclianus, the Prætorian
  præfect, by Marcian, a general of rank and reputation, and by
  Cecrops, who commanded a numerous body of Dalmatian guards. The death of
  Gallienus was resolved; and notwithstanding their desire of first
  terminating the siege of Milan, the extreme danger which accompanied every
  moment’s delay obliged them to hasten the execution of their daring
  purpose. At a late hour of the night, but while the emperor still
  protracted the pleasures of the table, an alarm was suddenly given, that
  Aureolus, at the head of all his forces, had made a desperate sally from
  the town; Gallienus, who was never deficient in personal bravery, started
  from his silken couch, and without allowing himself time either to put on
  his armor, or to assemble his guards, he mounted on horseback, and rode
  full speed towards the supposed place of the attack. Encompassed by his
  declared or concealed enemies, he soon, amidst the nocturnal tumult,
  received a mortal dart from an uncertain hand. Before he expired, a
  patriotic sentiment rising in the mind of Gallienus, induced him to name a
  deserving successor; and it was his last request, that the Imperial
  ornaments should be delivered to Claudius, who then commanded a detached
  army in the neighborhood of Pavia. The report at least was diligently
  propagated, and the order cheerfully obeyed by the conspirators, who had
  already agreed to place Claudius on the throne. On the first news of the
  emperor’s death, the troops expressed some suspicion and resentment, till
  the one was removed, and the other assuaged, by a donative of twenty
  pieces of gold to each soldier. They then ratified the election, and
  acknowledged the merit of their new sovereign.
</p>
<p>
  The obscurity which covered the origin of Claudius, though it was
  afterwards embellished by some flattering fictions, sufficiently betrays
  the meanness of his birth. We can only discover that he was a native of
  one of the provinces bordering on the Danube; that his youth was spent in
  arms, and that his modest valor attracted the favor and confidence of
  Decius. The senate and people already considered him as an excellent
  officer, equal to the most important trusts; and censured the inattention
  of Valerian, who suffered him to remain in the subordinate station of a
  tribune. But it was not long before that emperor distinguished the merit
  of Claudius, by declaring him general and chief of the Illyrian frontier,
  with the command of all the troops in Thrace, Mæsia, Dacia,
  Pannonia, and Dalmatia, the appointments of the præfect of Egypt,
  the establishment of the proconsul of Africa, and the sure prospect of the
  consulship. By his victories over the Goths, he deserved from the senate
  the honor of a statue, and excited the jealous apprehensions of Gallienus.
  It was impossible that a soldier could esteem so dissolute a sovereign,
  nor is it easy to conceal a just contempt. Some unguarded expressions
  which dropped from Claudius were officiously transmitted to the royal ear.
  The emperor’s answer to an officer of confidence describes in very lively
  colors his own character, and that of the times. “There is not any thing
  capable of giving me more serious concern, than the intelligence contained
  in your last despatch; that some malicious suggestions have indisposed
  towards us the mind of our friend and parent Claudius. As you regard your
  allegiance, use every means to appease his resentment, but conduct your
  negotiation with secrecy; let it not reach the knowledge of the Dacian
  troops; they are already provoked, and it might inflame their fury. I
  myself have sent him some presents: be it your care that he accept them
  with pleasure. Above all, let him not suspect that I am made acquainted
  with his imprudence. The fear of my anger might urge him to desperate
  counsels.” The presents which accompanied this humble epistle, in which
  the monarch solicited a reconciliation with his discontented subject,
  consisted of a considerable sum of money, a splendid wardrobe, and a
  valuable service of silver and gold plate. By such arts Gallienus softened
  the indignation and dispelled the fears of his Illyrian general; and
  during the remainder of that reign, the formidable sword of Claudius was
  always drawn in the cause of a master whom he despised. At last, indeed,
  he received from the conspirators the bloody purple of Gallienus: but he
  had been absent from their camp and counsels; and however he might applaud
  the deed, we may candidly presume that he was innocent of the knowledge of
  it. When Claudius ascended the throne, he was about fifty-four years of
  age.
</p>
<p>
  The siege of Milan was still continued, and Aureolus soon discovered that
  the success of his artifices had only raised up a more determined
  adversary. He attempted to negotiate with Claudius a treaty of alliance
  and partition. “Tell him,” replied the intrepid emperor, “that such
  proposals should have been made to Gallienus; <i>he</i>, perhaps, might
  have listened to them with patience, and accepted a colleague as
  despicable as himself.” This stern refusal, and a last unsuccessful
  effort, obliged Aureolus to yield the city and himself to the discretion
  of the conqueror. The judgment of the army pronounced him worthy of death;
  and Claudius, after a feeble resistance, consented to the execution of the
  sentence. Nor was the zeal of the senate less ardent in the cause of their
  new sovereign. They ratified, perhaps with a sincere transport of zeal,
  the election of Claudius; and, as his predecessor had shown himself the
  personal enemy of their order, they exercised, under the name of justice,
  a severe revenge against his friends and family. The senate was permitted
  to discharge the ungrateful office of punishment, and the emperor reserved
  for himself the pleasure and merit of obtaining by his intercession a
  general act of indemnity.
</p>
<p>
  Such ostentatious clemency discovers less of the real character of
  Claudius, than a trifling circumstance in which he seems to have consulted
  only the dictates of his heart. The frequent rebellions of the provinces
  had involved almost every person in the guilt of treason, almost every
  estate in the case of confiscation; and Gallienus often displayed his
  liberality by distributing among his officers the property of his
  subjects. On the accession of Claudius, an old woman threw herself at his
  feet, and complained that a general of the late emperor had obtained an
  arbitrary grant of her patrimony. This general was Claudius himself, who
  had not entirely escaped the contagion of the times. The emperor blushed
  at the reproach, but deserved the confidence which she had reposed in his
  equity. The confession of his fault was accompanied with immediate and
  ample restitution.
</p>
<p>
  In the arduous task which Claudius had undertaken, of restoring the empire
  to its ancient splendor, it was first necessary to revive among his troops
  a sense of order and obedience. With the authority of a veteran commander,
  he represented to them that the relaxation of discipline had introduced a
  long train of disorders, the effects of which were at length experienced
  by the soldiers themselves; that a people ruined by oppression, and
  indolent from despair, could no longer supply a numerous army with the
  means of luxury, or even of subsistence; that the danger of each
  individual had increased with the despotism of the military order, since
  princes who tremble on the throne will guard their safety by the instant
  sacrifice of every obnoxious subject. The emperor expiated on the
  mischiefs of a lawless caprice, which the soldiers could only gratify at
  the expense of their own blood; as their seditious elections had so
  frequently been followed by civil wars, which consumed the flower of the
  legions either in the field of battle, or in the cruel abuse of victory.
  He painted in the most lively colors the exhausted state of the treasury,
  the desolation of the provinces, the disgrace of the Roman name, and the
  insolent triumph of rapacious barbarians. It was against those barbarians,
  he declared, that he intended to point the first effort of their arms.
  Tetricus might reign for a while over the West, and even Zenobia might
  preserve the dominion of the East. These usurpers were his personal
  adversaries; nor could he think of indulging any private resentment till
  he had saved an empire, whose impending ruin would, unless it was timely
  prevented, crush both the army and the people.
</p>
<p>
  The various nations of Germany and Sarmatia, who fought under the Gothic
  standard, had already collected an armament more formidable than any which
  had yet issued from the Euxine. On the banks of the Niester, one of the
  great rivers that discharge themselves into that sea, they constructed a
  fleet of two thousand, or even of six thousand vessels; numbers which,
  however incredible they may seem, would have been insufficient to
  transport their pretended army of three hundred and twenty thousand
  barbarians. Whatever might be the real strength of the Goths, the vigor
  and success of the expedition were not adequate to the greatness of the
  preparations. In their passage through the Bosphorus, the unskilful pilots
  were overpowered by the violence of the current; and while the multitude
  of their ships were crowded in a narrow channel, many were dashed against
  each other, or against the shore. The barbarians made several descents on
  the coasts both of Europe and Asia; but the open country was already
  plundered, and they were repulsed with shame and loss from the fortified
  cities which they assaulted. A spirit of discouragement and division arose
  in the fleet, and some of their chiefs sailed away towards the islands of
  Crete and Cyprus; but the main body, pursuing a more steady course,
  anchored at length near the foot of Mount Athos, and assaulted the city of
  Thessalonica, the wealthy capital of all the Macedonian provinces. Their
  attacks, in which they displayed a fierce but artless bravery, were soon
  interrupted by the rapid approach of Claudius, hastening to a scene of
  action that deserved the presence of a warlike prince at the head of the
  remaining powers of the empire. Impatient for battle, the Goths
  immediately broke up their camp, relinquished the siege of Thessalonica,
  left their navy at the foot of Mount Athos, traversed the hills of
  Macedonia, and pressed forwards to engage the last defence of Italy.
</p>
<p>
  We still posses an original letter addressed by Claudius to the senate and
  people on this memorable occasion. “Conscript fathers,” says the emperor,
  “know that three hundred and twenty thousand Goths have invaded the Roman
  territory. If I vanquish them, your gratitude will reward my services.
  Should I fall, remember that I am the successor of Gallienus. The whole
  republic is fatigued and exhausted. We shall fight after Valerian, after
  Ingenuus, Regillianus, Lollianus, Posthumus, Celsus, and a thousand
  others, whom a just contempt for Gallienus provoked into rebellion. We are
  in want of darts, of spears, and of shields. The strength of the empire,
  Gaul, and Spain, are usurped by Tetricus, and we blush to acknowledge that
  the archers of the East serve under the banners of Zenobia. Whatever we
  shall perform will be sufficiently great.” The melancholy firmness of this
  epistle announces a hero careless of his fate, conscious of his danger,
  but still deriving a well-grounded hope from the resources of his own
  mind.
</p>
<p>
  The event surpassed his own expectations and those of the world. By the
  most signal victories he delivered the empire from this host of
  barbarians, and was distinguished by posterity under the glorious
  appellation of the Gothic Claudius. The imperfect historians of an
  irregular war do not enable us to describe the order and circumstances of
  his exploits; but, if we could be indulged in the allusion, we might
  distribute into three acts this memorable tragedy. I. The decisive battle
  was fought near Naissus, a city of Dardania. The legions at first gave
  way, oppressed by numbers, and dismayed by misfortunes. Their ruin was
  inevitable, had not the abilities of their emperor prepared a seasonable
  relief. A large detachment, rising out of the secret and difficult passes
  of the mountains, which, by his order, they had occupied, suddenly
  assailed the rear of the victorious Goths. The favorable instant was
  improved by the activity of Claudius. He revived the courage of his
  troops, restored their ranks, and pressed the barbarians on every side.
  Fifty thousand men are reported to have been slain in the battle of
  Naissus. Several large bodies of barbarians, covering their retreat with a
  movable fortification of wagons, retired, or rather escaped, from the
  field of slaughter. II. We may presume that some insurmountable
  difficulty, the fatigue, perhaps, or the disobedience, of the conquerors,
  prevented Claudius from completing in one day the destruction of the
  Goths. The war was diffused over the province of Mæsia, Thrace, and
  Macedonia, and its operations drawn out into a variety of marches,
  surprises, and tumultuary engagements, as well by sea as by land. When the
  Romans suffered any loss, it was commonly occasioned by their own
  cowardice or rashness; but the superior talents of the emperor, his
  perfect knowledge of the country, and his judicious choice of measures as
  well as officers, assured on most occasions the success of his arms. The
  immense booty, the fruit of so many victories, consisted for the greater
  part of cattle and slaves. A select body of the Gothic youth was received
  among the Imperial troops; the remainder was sold into servitude; and so
  considerable was the number of female captives that every soldier
  obtained to his share two or three women. A circumstance from which we may
  conclude, that the invaders entertained some designs of settlement as well
  as of plunder; since even in a naval expedition, they were accompanied by
  their families. III. The loss of their fleet, which was either taken or
  sunk, had intercepted the retreat of the Goths. A vast circle of Roman
  posts, distributed with skill, supported with firmness, and gradually
  closing towards a common centre, forced the barbarians into the most
  inaccessible parts of Mount Hæmus, where they found a safe refuge,
  but a very scanty subsistence. During the course of a rigorous winter in
  which they were besieged by the emperor’s troops, famine and pestilence,
  desertion and the sword, continually diminished the imprisoned multitude.
  On the return of spring, nothing appeared in arms except a hardy and
  desperate band, the remnant of that mighty host which had embarked at the
  mouth of the Niester.
</p>
<p>
  The pestilence which swept away such numbers of the barbarians, at length
  proved fatal to their conqueror. After a short but glorious reign of two
  years, Claudius expired at Sirmium, amidst the tears and acclamations of
  his subjects. In his last illness, he convened the principal officers of
  the state and army, and in their presence recommended Aurelian, one of his
  generals, as the most deserving of the throne, and the best qualified to
  execute the great design which he himself had been permitted only to
  undertake. The virtues of Claudius, his valor, affability, justice, and
  temperance, his love of fame and of his country, place him in that short
  list of emperors who added lustre to the Roman purple. Those virtues,
  however, were celebrated with peculiar zeal and complacency by the courtly
  writers of the age of Constantine, who was the great-grandson of Crispus,
  the elder brother of Claudius. The voice of flattery was soon taught to
  repeat, that gods, who so hastily had snatched Claudius from the earth,
  rewarded his merit and piety by the perpetual establishment of the empire
  in his family.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding these oracles, the greatness of the Flavian family (a name
  which it had pleased them to assume) was deferred above twenty years, and
  the elevation of Claudius occasioned the immediate ruin of his brother
  Quintilius, who possessed not sufficient moderation or courage to descend
  into the private station to which the patriotism of the late emperor had
  condemned him. Without delay or reflection, he assumed the purple at
  Aquileia, where he commanded a considerable force; and though his reign
  lasted only seventeen days, * he had time to obtain the sanction of the
  senate, and to experience a mutiny of the troops. As soon as he was
  informed that the great army of the Danube had invested the well-known
  valor of Aurelian with Imperial power, he sunk under the fame and merit of
  his rival; and ordering his veins to be opened, prudently withdrew himself
  from the unequal contest.
</p>
<p>
  The general design of this work will not permit us minutely to relate the
  actions of every emperor after he ascended the throne, much less to deduce
  the various fortunes of his private life. We shall only observe, that the
  father of Aurelian was a peasant of the territory of Sirmium, who occupied
  a small farm, the property of Aurelius, a rich senator. His warlike son
  enlisted in the troops as a common soldier, successively rose to the rank
  of a centurion, a tribune, the præfect of a legion, the inspector of
  the camp, the general, or, as it was then called, the duke, of a frontier;
  and at length, during the Gothic war, exercised the important office of
  commander-in-chief of the cavalry. In every station he distinguished
  himself by matchless valor, rigid discipline, and successful conduct. He
  was invested with the consulship by the emperor Valerian, who styles him,
  in the pompous language of that age, the deliverer of Illyricum, the
  restorer of Gaul, and the rival of the Scipios. At the recommendation of
  Valerian, a senator of the highest rank and merit, Ulpius Crinitus, whose
  blood was derived from the same source as that of Trajan, adopted the
  Pannonian peasant, gave him his daughter in marriage, and relieved with
  his ample fortune the honorable poverty which Aurelian had preserved
  inviolate.
</p>
<p>
  The reign of Aurelian lasted only four years and about nine months; but
  every instant of that short period was filled by some memorable
  achievement. He put an end to the Gothic war, chastised the Germans who
  invaded Italy, recovered Gaul, Spain, and Britain out of the hands of
  Tetricus, and destroyed the proud monarchy which Zenobia had erected in
  the East on the ruins of the afflicted empire.
</p>
<p>
  It was the rigid attention of Aurelian, even to the minutest articles of
  discipline, which bestowed such uninterrupted success on his arms. His
  military regulations are contained in a very concise epistle to one of his
  inferior officers, who is commanded to enforce them, as he wishes to
  become a tribune, or as he is desirous to live. Gaming, drinking, and the
  arts of divination, were severely prohibited. Aurelian expected that his
  soldiers should be modest, frugal, and laborious; that their armor should
  be constantly kept bright, their weapons sharp, their clothing and horses
  ready for immediate service; that they should live in their quarters with
  chastity and sobriety, without damaging the cornfields, without stealing
  even a sheep, a fowl, or a bunch of grapes, without exacting from their
  landlords either salt, or oil, or wood. “The public allowance,” continues
  the emperor, “is sufficient for their support; their wealth should be
  collected from the spoils of the enemy, not from the tears of the
  provincials.” A single instance will serve to display the rigor, and even
  cruelty, of Aurelian. One of the soldiers had seduced the wife of his
  host. The guilty wretch was fastened to two trees forcibly drawn towards
  each other, and his limbs were torn asunder by their sudden separation. A
  few such examples impressed a salutary consternation. The punishments of
  Aurelian were terrible; but he had seldom occasion to punish more than
  once the same offence. His own conduct gave a sanction to his laws, and
  the seditious legions dreaded a chief who had learned to obey, and who was
  worthy to command.

<h2>
  Chapter XI: Reign Of Claudius, Defeat Of The Goths.—Part II.
</h2>
<p>
  The death of Claudius had revived the fainting spirit of the Goths. The
  troops which guarded the passes of Mount Hæmus, and the banks of the
  Danube, had been drawn away by the apprehension of a civil war; and it
  seems probable that the remaining body of the Gothic and Vandalic tribes
  embraced the favorable opportunity, abandoned their settlements of the
  Ukraine, traversed the rivers, and swelled with new multitudes the
  destroying host of their countrymen. Their united numbers were at length
  encountered by Aurelian, and the bloody and doubtful conflict ended only
  with the approach of night. Exhausted by so many calamities, which they
  had mutually endured and inflicted during a twenty years’ war, the Goths
  and the Romans consented to a lasting and beneficial treaty. It was
  earnestly solicited by the barbarians, and cheerfully ratified by the
  legions, to whose suffrage the prudence of Aurelian referred the decision
  of that important question. The Gothic nation engaged to supply the armies
  of Rome with a body of two thousand auxiliaries, consisting entirely of
  cavalry, and stipulated in return an undisturbed retreat, with a regular
  market as far as the Danube, provided by the emperor’s care, but at their
  own expense. The treaty was observed with such religious fidelity, that
  when a party of five hundred men straggled from the camp in quest of
  plunder, the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the guilty
  leader should be apprehended and shot to death with darts, as a victim
  devoted to the sanctity of their engagements. * It is, however, not
  unlikely, that the precaution of Aurelian, who had exacted as hostages the
  sons and daughters of the Gothic chiefs, contributed something to this
  pacific temper. The youths he trained in the exercise of arms, and near
  his own person: to the damsels he gave a liberal and Roman education, and
  by bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers, gradually
  introduced between the two nations the closest and most endearing
  connections.
</p>
<p>
  But the most important condition of peace was understood rather than
  expressed in the treaty. Aurelian withdrew the Roman forces from Dacia,
  and tacitly relinquished that great province to the Goths and Vandals. His
  manly judgment convinced him of the solid advantages, and taught him to
  despise the seeming disgrace, of thus contracting the frontiers of the
  monarchy. The Dacian subjects, removed from those distant possessions
  which they were unable to cultivate or defend, added strength and
  populousness to the southern side of the Danube. A fertile territory,
  which the repetition of barbarous inroads had changed into a desert, was
  yielded to their industry, and a new province of Dacia still preserved the
  memory of Trajan’s conquests. The old country of that name detained,
  however, a considerable number of its inhabitants, who dreaded exile more
  than a Gothic master. These degenerate Romans continued to serve the
  empire, whose allegiance they had renounced, by introducing among their
  conquerors the first notions of agriculture, the useful arts, and the
  conveniences of civilized life. An intercourse of commerce and language
  was gradually established between the opposite banks of the Danube; and
  after Dacia became an independent state, it often proved the firmest
  barrier of the empire against the invasions of the savages of the North. A
  sense of interest attached these more settled barbarians to the alliance
  of Rome, and a permanent interest very frequently ripens into sincere and
  useful friendship. This various colony, which filled the ancient province,
  and was insensibly blended into one great people, still acknowledged the
  superior renown and authority of the Gothic tribe, and claimed the fancied
  honor of a Scandinavian origin. At the same time, the lucky though
  accidental resemblance of the name of Getæ, * infused among the
  credulous Goths a vain persuasion, that in a remote age, their own
  ancestors, already seated in the Dacian provinces, had received the
  instructions of Zamolxis, and checked the victorious arms of Sesostris and
  Darius.
</p>
<p>
  While the vigorous and moderate conduct of Aurelian restored the Illyrian
  frontier, the nation of the Alemanni violated the conditions of peace,
  which either Gallienus had purchased, or Claudius had imposed, and,
  inflamed by their impatient youth, suddenly flew to arms. Forty thousand
  horse appeared in the field, and the numbers of the infantry doubled those
  of the cavalry. The first objects of their avarice were a few cities of
  the Rhætian frontier; but their hopes soon rising with success, the
  rapid march of the Alemanni traced a line of devastation from the Danube
  to the Po.
</p>
<p>
  The emperor was almost at the same time informed of the irruption, and of
  the retreat, of the barbarians. Collecting an active body of troops, he
  marched with silence and celerity along the skirts of the Hercynian
  forest; and the Alemanni, laden with the spoils of Italy, arrived at the
  Danube, without suspecting, that on the opposite bank, and in an
  advantageous post, a Roman army lay concealed and prepared to intercept
  their return. Aurelian indulged the fatal security of the barbarians, and
  permitted about half their forces to pass the river without disturbance
  and without precaution. Their situation and astonishment gave him an easy
  victory; his skilful conduct improved the advantage. Disposing the legions
  in a semicircular form, he advanced the two horns of the crescent across
  the Danube, and wheeling them on a sudden towards the centre, enclosed the
  rear of the German host. The dismayed barbarians, on whatsoever side they
  cast their eyes, beheld, with despair, a wasted country, a deep and rapid
  stream, a victorious and implacable enemy.
</p>
<p>
  Reduced to this distressed condition, the Alemanni no longer disdained to
  sue for peace. Aurelian received their ambassadors at the head of his
  camp, and with every circumstance of martial pomp that could display the
  greatness and discipline of Rome. The legions stood to their arms in
  well-ordered ranks and awful silence. The principal commanders,
  distinguished by the ensigns of their rank, appeared on horseback on
  either side of the Imperial throne. Behind the throne the consecrated
  images of the emperor, and his predecessors, the golden eagles, and the
  various titles of the legions, engraved in letters of gold, were exalted
  in the air on lofty pikes covered with silver. When Aurelian assumed his
  seat, his manly grace and majestic figure taught the barbarians to revere
  the person as well as the purple of their conqueror. The ambassadors fell
  prostrate on the ground in silence. They were commanded to rise, and
  permitted to speak. By the assistance of interpreters they extenuated
  their perfidy, magnified their exploits, expatiated on the vicissitudes of
  fortune and the advantages of peace, and, with an ill-timed confidence,
  demanded a large subsidy, as the price of the alliance which they offered
  to the Romans. The answer of the emperor was stern and imperious. He
  treated their offer with contempt, and their demand with indignation,
  reproached the barbarians, that they were as ignorant of the arts of war
  as of the laws of peace, and finally dismissed them with the choice only
  of submitting to this unconditional mercy, or awaiting the utmost severity
  of his resentment. Aurelian had resigned a distant province to the Goths;
  but it was dangerous to trust or to pardon these perfidious barbarians,
  whose formidable power kept Italy itself in perpetual alarms.
</p>
<p>
  Immediately after this conference, it should seem that some unexpected
  emergency required the emperor’s presence in Pannonia. He devolved on his
  lieutenants the care of finishing the destruction of the Alemanni, either
  by the sword, or by the surer operation of famine. But an active despair
  has often triumphed over the indolent assurance of success. The
  barbarians, finding it impossible to traverse the Danube and the Roman
  camp, broke through the posts in their rear, which were more feebly or
  less carefully guarded; and with incredible diligence, but by a different
  road, returned towards the mountains of Italy. Aurelian, who considered
  the war as totally extinguished, received the mortifying intelligence of
  the escape of the Alemanni, and of the ravage which they already committed
  in the territory of Milan. The legions were commanded to follow, with as
  much expedition as those heavy bodies were capable of exerting, the rapid
  flight of an enemy whose infantry and cavalry moved with almost equal
  swiftness. A few days afterwards, the emperor himself marched to the
  relief of Italy, at the head of a chosen body of auxiliaries, (among whom
  were the hostages and cavalry of the Vandals,) and of all the Prætorian
  guards who had served in the wars on the Danube.
</p>
<p>
  As the light troops of the Alemanni had spread themselves from the Alps to
  the Apennine, the incessant vigilance of Aurelian and his officers was
  exercised in the discovery, the attack, and the pursuit of the numerous
  detachments. Notwithstanding this desultory war, three considerable
  battles are mentioned, in which the principal force of both armies was
  obstinately engaged. The success was various. In the first, fought near
  Placentia, the Romans received so severe a blow, that, according to the
  expression of a writer extremely partial to Aurelian, the immediate
  dissolution of the empire was apprehended. The crafty barbarians, who had
  lined the woods, suddenly attacked the legions in the dusk of the evening,
  and, it is most probable, after the fatigue and disorder of a long march.
  The fury of their charge was irresistible; but, at length, after a
  dreadful slaughter, the patient firmness of the emperor rallied his
  troops, and restored, in some degree, the honor of his arms. The second
  battle was fought near Fano in Umbria; on the spot which, five hundred
  years before, had been fatal to the brother of Hannibal. Thus far the
  successful Germans had advanced along the Æmilian and Flaminian way,
  with a design of sacking the defenceless mistress of the world. But
  Aurelian, who, watchful for the safety of Rome, still hung on their rear,
  found in this place the decisive moment of giving them a total and
  irretrievable defeat. The flying remnant of their host was exterminated in
  a third and last battle near Pavia; and Italy was delivered from the
  inroads of the Alemanni.
</p>
<p>
  Fear has been the original parent of superstition, and every new calamity
  urges trembling mortals to deprecate the wrath of their invisible enemies.
  Though the best hope of the republic was in the valor and conduct of
  Aurelian, yet such was the public consternation, when the barbarians were
  hourly expected at the gates of Rome, that, by a decree of the senate the
  Sibylline books were consulted. Even the emperor himself, from a motive
  either of religion or of policy, recommended this salutary measure, chided
  the tardiness of the senate, and offered to supply whatever expense,
  whatever animals, whatever captives of any nation, the gods should
  require. Notwithstanding this liberal offer, it does not appear, that any
  human victims expiated with their blood the sins of the Roman people. The
  Sibylline books enjoined ceremonies of a more harmless nature, processions
  of priests in white robes, attended by a chorus of youths and virgins;
  lustrations of the city and adjacent country; and sacrifices, whose
  powerful influence disabled the barbarians from passing the mystic ground
  on which they had been celebrated. However puerile in themselves, these
  superstitious arts were subservient to the success of the war; and if, in
  the decisive battle of Fano, the Alemanni fancied they saw an army of
  spectres combating on the side of Aurelian, he received a real and
  effectual aid from this imaginary reënforcement.
</p>
<p>
  But whatever confidence might be placed in ideal ramparts, the experience
  of the past, and the dread of the future, induced the Romans to construct
  fortifications of a grosser and more substantial kind. The seven hills of
  Rome had been surrounded by the successors of Romulus with an ancient
  wall of more than thirteen miles. The vast enclosure may seem
  disproportioned to the strength and numbers of the infant-state. But it
  was necessary to secure an ample extent of pasture and arable land
  against the frequent and sudden incursions of the tribes of Latium, the
  perpetual enemies of the republic. With the progress of Roman greatness,
  the city and its inhabitants gradually increased, filled up the vacant
  space, pierced through the useless walls, covered the field of Mars, and,
  on every side, followed the public highways in long and beautiful suburbs.
  The extent of the new walls, erected by Aurelian, and finished in the
  reign of Probus, was magnified by popular estimation to near fifty, but is
  reduced by accurate measurement to about twenty-one miles. It was a great
  but a melancholy labor, since the defence of the capital betrayed the
  decline of monarchy. The Romans of a more prosperous age, who trusted
  to the arms of the legions the safety of the frontier camps, were very far
  from entertaining a suspicion that it would ever become necessary to
  fortify the seat of empire against the inroads of the barbarians.
</p>
<p>
  The victory of Claudius over the Goths, and the success of Aurelian
  against the Alemanni, had already restored to the arms of Rome their
  ancient superiority over the barbarous nations of the North. To chastise
  domestic tyrants, and to reunite the dismembered parts of the empire, was
  a task reserved for the second of those warlike emperors. Though he was
  acknowledged by the senate and people, the frontiers of Italy, Africa,
  Illyricum, and Thrace, confined the limits of his reign. Gaul, Spain, and
  Britain, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, were still possessed by two rebels,
  who alone, out of so numerous a list, had hitherto escaped the dangers of
  their situation; and to complete the ignominy of Rome, these rival thrones
  had been usurped by women.
</p>
<p>
  A rapid succession of monarchs had arisen and fallen in the provinces of
  Gaul. The rigid virtues of Posthumus served only to hasten his
  destruction. After suppressing a competitor, who had assumed the purple at
  Mentz, he refused to gratify his troops with the plunder of the rebellious
  city; and in the seventh year of his reign, became the victim of their
  disappointed avarice. The death of Victorinus, his friend and associate,
  was occasioned by a less worthy cause. The shining accomplishments of that
  prince were stained by a licentious passion, which he indulged in acts of
  violence, with too little regard to the laws of society, or even to those
  of love. He was slain at Cologne, by a conspiracy of jealous husbands,
  whose revenge would have appeared more justifiable, had they spared the
  innocence of his son. After the murder of so many valiant princes, it is
  somewhat remarkable, that a female for a long time controlled the fierce
  legions of Gaul, and still more singular, that she was the mother of the
  unfortunate Victorinus. The arts and treasures of Victoria enabled her
  successively to place Marius and Tetricus on the throne, and to reign with
  a manly vigor under the name of those dependent emperors. Money of copper,
  of silver, and of gold, was coined in her name; she assumed the titles of
  Augusta and Mother of the Camps: her power ended only with her life; but
  her life was perhaps shortened by the ingratitude of Tetricus.
</p>
<p>
  When, at the instigation of his ambitious patroness, Tetricus assumed the
  ensigns of royalty, he was governor of the peaceful province of Aquitaine,
  an employment suited to his character and education. He reigned four or
  five years over Gaul, Spain, and Britain, the slave and sovereign of a
  licentious army, whom he dreaded, and by whom he was despised. The valor
  and fortune of Aurelian at length opened the prospect of a deliverance. He
  ventured to disclose his melancholy situation, and conjured the emperor to
  hasten to the relief of his unhappy rival. Had this secret correspondence
  reached the ears of the soldiers, it would most probably have cost
  Tetricus his life; nor could he resign the sceptre of the West without
  committing an act of treason against himself. He affected the appearances
  of a civil war, led his forces into the field, against Aurelian, posted
  them in the most disadvantageous manner, betrayed his own counsels to his
  enemy, and with a few chosen friends deserted in the beginning of the
  action. The rebel legions, though disordered and dismayed by the
  unexpected treachery of their chief, defended themselves with desperate
  valor, till they were cut in pieces almost to a man, in this bloody and
  memorable battle, which was fought near Chalons in Champagne. The retreat
  of the irregular auxiliaries, Franks and Batavians, whom the conqueror
  soon compelled or persuaded to repass the Rhine, restored the general
  tranquillity, and the power of Aurelian was acknowledged from the wall of
  Antoninus to the columns of Hercules.
</p>
<p>
  As early as the reign of Claudius, the city of Autun, alone and
  unassisted, had ventured to declare against the legions of Gaul. After a
  siege of seven months, they stormed and plundered that unfortunate city,
  already wasted by famine. Lyons, on the contrary, had resisted with
  obstinate disaffection the arms of Aurelian. We read of the punishment of
  Lyons, but there is not any mention of the rewards of Autun. Such, indeed,
  is the policy of civil war: severely to remember injuries, and to forget
  the most important services. Revenge is profitable, gratitude is
  expensive.
</p>
<p>
  Aurelian had no sooner secured the person and provinces of Tetricus, than
  he turned his arms against Zenobia, the celebrated queen of Palmyra and
  the East. Modern Europe has produced several illustrious women who have
  sustained with glory the weight of empire; nor is our own age destitute of
  such distinguished characters. But if we except the doubtful achievements
  of Semiramis, Zenobia is perhaps the only female whose superior genius
  broke through the servile indolence imposed on her sex by the climate and
  manners of Asia. She claimed her descent from the Macedonian kings of
  Egypt, * equalled in beauty her ancestor Cleopatra, and far surpassed that
  princess in chastity and valor. Zenobia was esteemed the most lovely as
  well as the most heroic of her sex. She was of a dark complexion (for in
  speaking of a lady these trifles become important). Her teeth were of a
  pearly whiteness, and her large black eyes sparkled with uncommon fire,
  tempered by the most attractive sweetness. Her voice was strong and
  harmonious. Her manly understanding was strengthened and adorned by study.
  She was not ignorant of the Latin tongue, but possessed in equal
  perfection the Greek, the Syriac, and the Egyptian languages. She had
  drawn up for her own use an epitome of oriental history, and familiarly
  compared the beauties of Homer and Plato under the tuition of the sublime
  Longinus.
</p>
<p>
  This accomplished woman gave her hand to Odenathus, who, from a private
  station, raised himself to the dominion of the East. She soon became the
  friend and companion of a hero. In the intervals of war, Odenathus
  passionately delighted in the exercise of hunting; he pursued with ardor
  the wild beasts of the desert, lions, panthers, and bears; and the ardor
  of Zenobia in that dangerous amusement was not inferior to his own. She
  had inured her constitution to fatigue, disdained the use of a covered
  carriage, generally appeared on horseback in a military habit, and
  sometimes marched several miles on foot at the head of the troops. The
  success of Odenathus was in a great measure ascribed to her incomparable
  prudence and fortitude. Their splendid victories over the Great King, whom
  they twice pursued as far as the gates of Ctesiphon, laid the foundations
  of their united fame and power. The armies which they commanded, and the
  provinces which they had saved, acknowledged not any other sovereigns than
  their invincible chiefs. The senate and people of Rome revered a stranger
  who had avenged their captive emperor, and even the insensible son of
  Valerian accepted Odenathus for his legitimate colleague.

<h2>
  Chapter XI: Reign Of Claudius, Defeat Of The Goths.—Part III.
</h2>
<p>
  After a successful expedition against the Gothic plunderers of Asia, the
  Palmyrenian prince returned to the city of Emesa in Syria. Invincible in
  war, he was there cut off by domestic treason, and his favorite amusement
  of hunting was the cause, or at least the occasion, of his death. His
  nephew Mæonius presumed to dart his javelin before that of his
  uncle; and though admonished of his error, repeated the same insolence. As
  a monarch, and as a sportsman, Odenathus was provoked, took away his
  horse, a mark of ignominy among the barbarians, and chastised the rash
  youth by a short confinement. The offence was soon forgot, but the
  punishment was remembered; and Mæonius, with a few daring
  associates, assassinated his uncle in the midst of a great entertainment.
  Herod, the son of Odenathus, though not of Zenobia, a young man of a soft
  and effeminate temper, was killed with his father. But Mæonius
  obtained only the pleasure of revenge by this bloody deed. He had scarcely
  time to assume the title of Augustus, before he was sacrificed by Zenobia
  to the memory of her husband.
</p>
<p>
  With the assistance of his most faithful friends, she immediately filled
  the vacant throne, and governed with manly counsels Palmyra, Syria, and
  the East, above five years. By the death of Odenathus, that authority was
  at an end which the senate had granted him only as a personal distinction;
  but his martial widow, disdaining both the senate and Gallienus, obliged
  one of the Roman generals, who was sent against her, to retreat into
  Europe, with the loss of his army and his reputation. Instead of the
  little passions which so frequently perplex a female reign, the steady
  administration of Zenobia was guided by the most judicious maxims of
  policy. If it was expedient to pardon, she could calm her resentment; if
  it was necessary to punish, she could impose silence on the voice of pity.
  Her strict economy was accused of avarice; yet on every proper occasion
  she appeared magnificent and liberal. The neighboring states of Arabia,
  Armenia, and Persia, dreaded her enmity, and solicited her alliance. To
  the dominions of Odenathus, which extended from the Euphrates to the
  frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the inheritance of her ancestors,
  the populous and fertile kingdom of Egypt. * The emperor Claudius
  acknowledged her merit, and was content, that, while <i>he</i> pursued
  the Gothic war, <i>she</i>should assert the dignity of the empire in the
  East. The conduct, however, of Zenobia was attended with some
  ambiguity; not is it unlikely that she had conceived the design of
  erecting an independent and hostile monarchy. She blended with the popular
  manners of Roman princes the stately pomp of the courts of Asia, and
  exacted from her subjects the same adoration that was paid to the
  successor of Cyrus. She bestowed on her three sons a Latin education, and
  often showed them to the troops adorned with the Imperial purple. For
  herself she reserved the diadem, with the splendid but doubtful title of
  Queen of the East.
</p>
<p>
  When Aurelian passed over into Asia, against an adversary whose sex alone
  could render her an object of contempt, his presence restored obedience to
  the province of Bithynia, already shaken by the arms and intrigues of
  Zenobia. Advancing at the head of his legions, he accepted the submission
  of Ancyra, and was admitted into Tyana, after an obstinate siege, by the
  help of a perfidious citizen. The generous though fierce temper of
  Aurelian abandoned the traitor to the rage of the soldiers; a
  superstitious reverence induced him to treat with lenity the countrymen of
  Apollonius the philosopher. Antioch was deserted on his approach, till the
  emperor, by his salutary edicts, recalled the fugitives, and granted a
  general pardon to all who, from necessity rather than choice, had been
  engaged in the service of the Palmyrenian Queen. The unexpected mildness
  of such a conduct reconciled the minds of the Syrians, and as far as the
  gates of Emesa, the wishes of the people seconded the terror of his arms.
</p>
<p>
  Zenobia would have ill deserved her reputation, had she indolently
  permitted the emperor of the West to approach within a hundred miles of
  her capital. The fate of the East was decided in two great battles; so
  similar in almost every circumstance, that we can scarcely distinguish
  them from each other, except by observing that the first was fought near
  Antioch, and the second near Emesa. In both the queen of Palmyra animated
  the armies by her presence, and devolved the execution of her orders on
  Zabdas, who had already signalized his military talents by the conquest of
  Egypt. The numerous forces of Zenobia consisted for the most part of light
  archers, and of heavy cavalry clothed in complete steel. The Moorish and
  Illyrian horse of Aurelian were unable to sustain the ponderous charge of
  their antagonists. They fled in real or affected disorder, engaged the
  Palmyrenians in a laborious pursuit, harassed them by a desultory combat,
  and at length discomfited this impenetrable but unwieldy body of cavalry.
  The light infantry, in the mean time, when they had exhausted their
  quivers, remaining without protection against a closer onset, exposed
  their naked sides to the swords of the legions. Aurelian had chosen these
  veteran troops, who were usually stationed on the Upper Danube, and whose
  valor had been severely tried in the Alemannic war. After the defeat of
  Emesa, Zenobia found it impossible to collect a third army. As far as the
  frontier of Egypt, the nations subject to her empire had joined the
  standard of the conqueror, who detached Probus, the bravest of his
  generals, to possess himself of the Egyptian provinces. Palmyra was the
  last resource of the widow of Odenathus. She retired within the walls of
  her capital, made every preparation for a vigorous resistance, and
  declared, with the intrepidity of a heroine, that the last moment of her
  reign and of her life should be the same.
</p>
<p>
  Amid the barren deserts of Arabia, a few cultivated spots rise like
  islands out of the sandy ocean. Even the name of Tadmor, or Palmyra, by
  its signification in the Syriac as well as in the Latin language, denoted
  the multitude of palm-trees which afforded shade and verdure to that
  temperate region. The air was pure, and the soil, watered by some
  invaluable springs, was capable of producing fruits as well as corn. A
  place possessed of such singular advantages, and situated at a convenient
  distance between the Gulf of Persia and the Mediterranean, was soon
  frequented by the caravans which conveyed to the nations of Europe a
  considerable part of the rich commodities of India. Palmyra insensibly
  increased into an opulent and independent city, and connecting the Roman
  and the Parthian monarchies by the mutual benefits of commerce, was
  suffered to observe an humble neutrality, till at length, after the
  victories of Trajan, the little republic sunk into the bosom of Rome, and
  flourished more than one hundred and fifty years in the subordinate though
  honorable rank of a colony. It was during that peaceful period, if we may
  judge from a few remaining inscriptions, that the wealthy Palmyrenians
  constructed those temples, palaces, and porticos of Grecian architecture,
  whose ruins, scattered over an extent of several miles, have deserved the
  curiosity of our travellers. The elevation of Odenathus and Zenobia
  appeared to reflect new splendor on their country, and Palmyra, for a
  while, stood forth the rival of Rome: but the competition was fatal, and
  ages of prosperity were sacrificed to a moment of glory.
</p>
<p>
  In his march over the sandy desert between Emesa and Palmyra, the emperor
  Aurelian was perpetually harassed by the Arabs; nor could he always defend
  his army, and especially his baggage, from those flying troops of active
  and daring robbers, who watched the moment of surprise, and eluded the
  slow pursuit of the legions. The siege of Palmyra was an object far more
  difficult and important, and the emperor, who, with incessant vigor,
  pressed the attacks in person, was himself wounded with a dart. “The Roman
  people,” says Aurelian, in an original letter, “speak with contempt of the
  war which I am waging against a woman. They are ignorant both of the
  character and of the power of Zenobia. It is impossible to enumerate her
  warlike preparations, of stones, of arrows, and of every species of
  missile weapons. Every part of the walls is provided with two or three <i>balistæ</i>
  and artificial fires are thrown from her military engines. The fear of
  punishment has armed her with a desperate courage. Yet still I trust in
  the protecting deities of Rome, who have hitherto been favorable to all my
  undertakings.” Doubtful, however, of the protection of the gods, and of
  the event of the siege, Aurelian judged it more prudent to offer terms of
  an advantageous capitulation; to the queen, a splendid retreat; to the
  citizens, their ancient privileges. His proposals were obstinately
  rejected, and the refusal was accompanied with insult.
</p>
<p>
  The firmness of Zenobia was supported by the hope, that in a very short
  time famine would compel the Roman army to repass the desert; and by the
  reasonable expectation that the kings of the East, and particularly the
  Persian monarch, would arm in the defence of their most natural ally. But
  fortune, and the perseverance of Aurelian, overcame every obstacle. The
  death of Sapor, which happened about this time, distracted the councils of
  Persia, and the inconsiderable succors that attempted to relieve Palmyra
  were easily intercepted either by the arms or the liberality of the
  emperor. From every part of Syria, a regular succession of convoys safely
  arrived in the camp, which was increased by the return of Probus with his
  victorious troops from the conquest of Egypt. It was then that Zenobia
  resolved to fly. She mounted the fleetest of her dromedaries, and had
  already reached the banks of the Euphrates, about sixty miles from
  Palmyra, when she was overtaken by the pursuit of Aurelian’s light horse,
  seized, and brought back a captive to the feet of the emperor. Her capital
  soon afterwards surrendered, and was treated with unexpected lenity. The
  arms, horses, and camels, with an immense treasure of gold, silver, silk,
  and precious stones, were all delivered to the conqueror, who, leaving
  only a garrison of six hundred archers, returned to Emesa, and employed
  some time in the distribution of rewards and punishments at the end of so
  memorable a war, which restored to the obedience of Rome those provinces
  that had renounced their allegiance since the captivity of Valerian.
</p>
<p>
  When the Syrian queen was brought into the presence of Aurelian, he
  sternly asked her, How she had presumed to rise in arms against the
  emperors of Rome! The answer of Zenobia was a prudent mixture of respect
  and firmness. “Because I disdained to consider as Roman emperors an
  Aureolus or a Gallienus. You alone I acknowledge as my conqueror and my
  sovereign.” But as female fortitude is commonly artificial, so it is
  seldom steady or consistent. The courage of Zenobia deserted her in the
  hour of trial; she trembled at the angry clamors of the soldiers, who
  called aloud for her immediate execution, forgot the generous despair of
  Cleopatra, which she had proposed as her model, and ignominiously
  purchased life by the sacrifice of her fame and her friends. It was to
  their counsels, which governed the weakness of her sex, that she imputed
  the guilt of her obstinate resistance; it was on their heads that she
  directed the vengeance of the cruel Aurelian. The fame of Longinus, who
  was included among the numerous and perhaps innocent victims of her fear,
  will survive that of the queen who betrayed, or the tyrant who condemned
  him. Genius and learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered
  soldier, but they had served to elevate and harmonize the soul of
  Longinus. Without uttering a complaint, he calmly followed the
  executioner, pitying his unhappy mistress, and bestowing comfort on his
  afflicted friends.
</p>
<p>
  Returning from the conquest of the East, Aurelian had already crossed the
  Straits which divided Europe from Asia, when he was provoked by the
  intelligence that the Palmyrenians had massacred the governor and garrison
  which he had left among them, and again erected the standard of revolt.
  Without a moment’s deliberation, he once more turned his face towards
  Syria. Antioch was alarmed by his rapid approach, and the helpless city of
  Palmyra felt the irresistible weight of his resentment. We have a letter
  of Aurelian himself, in which he acknowledges, that old men, women,
  children, and peasants, had been involved in that dreadful execution,
  which should have been confined to armed rebellion; and although his
  principal concern seems directed to the reëstablishment of a temple of the
  Sun, he discovers some pity for the remnant of the Palmyrenians, to whom
  he grants the permission of rebuilding and inhabiting their city. But it
  is easier to destroy than to restore. The seat of commerce, of arts, and
  of Zenobia, gradually sunk into an obscure town, a trifling fortress, and
  at length a miserable village. The present citizens of Palmyra, consisting
  of thirty or forty families, have erected their mud cottages within the
  spacious court of a magnificent temple.
</p>
<p>
  Another and a last labor still awaited the indefatigable Aurelian; to
  suppress a dangerous though obscure rebel, who, during the revolt of
  Palmyra, had arisen on the banks of the Nile. Firmus, the friend and ally,
  as he proudly styled himself, of Odenathus and Zenobia, was no more than a
  wealthy merchant of Egypt. In the course of his trade to India, he had
  formed very intimate connections with the Saracens and the Blemmyes, whose
  situation on either coast of the Red Sea gave them an easy introduction
  into the Upper Egypt. The Egyptians he inflamed with the hope of freedom,
  and, at the head of their furious multitude, broke into the city of
  Alexandria, where he assumed the Imperial purple, coined money, published
  edicts, and raised an army, which, as he vainly boasted, he was capable of
  maintaining from the sole profits of his paper trade. Such troops were a
  feeble defence against the approach of Aurelian; and it seems almost
  unnecessary to relate, that Firmus was routed, taken, tortured, and put to
  death. Aurelian might now congratulate the senate, the people, and
  himself, that in little more than three years, he had restored universal
  peace and order to the Roman world.
</p>
<p>
  Since the foundation of Rome, no general had more nobly deserved a triumph
  than Aurelian; nor was a triumph ever celebrated with superior pride and
  magnificence. The pomp was opened by twenty elephants, four royal tigers,
  and above two hundred of the most curious animals from every climate of
  the North, the East, and the South. They were followed by sixteen hundred
  gladiators, devoted to the cruel amusement of the amphitheatre. The wealth
  of Asia, the arms and ensigns of so many conquered nations, and the
  magnificent plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen, were disposed in exact
  symmetry or artful disorder. The ambassadors of the most remote parts of
  the earth, of Æthiopia, Arabia, Persia, Bactriana, India, and China,
  all remarkable by their rich or singular dresses, displayed the fame and
  power of the Roman emperor, who exposed likewise to the public view the
  presents that he had received, and particularly a great number of crowns
  of gold, the offerings of grateful cities. The victories of Aurelian were
  attested by the long train of captives who reluctantly attended his
  triumph, Goths, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alemanni, Franks, Gauls, Syrians, and
  Egyptians. Each people was distinguished by its peculiar inscription, and
  the title of Amazons was bestowed on ten martial heroines of the Gothic
  nation who had been taken in arms. But every eye, disregarding the crowd
  of captives, was fixed on the emperor Tetricus and the queen of the East.
  The former, as well as his son, whom he had created Augustus, was dressed
  in Gallic trousers, a saffron tunic, and a robe of purple. The beauteous
  figure of Zenobia was confined by fetters of gold; a slave supported the
  gold chain which encircled her neck, and she almost fainted under the
  intolerable weight of jewels. She preceded on foot the magnificent
  chariot, in which she once hoped to enter the gates of Rome. It was
  followed by two other chariots, still more sumptuous, of Odenathus and of
  the Persian monarch. The triumphal car of Aurelian (it had formerly been
  used by a Gothic king) was drawn, on this memorable occasion, either by
  four stags or by four elephants. The most illustrious of the senate, the
  people, and the army, closed the solemn procession. Unfeigned joy, wonder,
  and gratitude, swelled the acclamations of the multitude; but the
  satisfaction of the senate was clouded by the appearance of Tetricus; nor
  could they suppress a rising murmur, that the haughty emperor should thus
  expose to public ignominy the person of a Roman and a magistrate.
</p>
<p>
  But however, in the treatment of his unfortunate rivals, Aurelian might
  indulge his pride, he behaved towards them with a generous clemency, which
  was seldom exercised by the ancient conquerors. Princes who, without
  success, had defended their throne or freedom, were frequently strangled
  in prison, as soon as the triumphal pomp ascended the Capitol. These
  usurpers, whom their defeat had convicted of the crime of treason, were
  permitted to spend their lives in affluence and honorable repose. The
  emperor presented Zenobia with an elegant villa at Tibur, or Tivoli, about
  twenty miles from the capital; the Syrian queen insensibly sunk into a
  Roman matron, her daughters married into noble families, and her race was
  not yet extinct in the fifth century. Tetricus and his son were reinstated
  in their rank and fortunes. They erected on the Cælian hill a
  magnificent palace, and as soon as it was finished, invited Aurelian to
  supper. On his entrance, he was agreeably surprised with a picture which
  represented their singular history. They were delineated offering to the
  emperor a civic crown and the sceptre of Gaul, and again receiving at his
  hands the ornaments of the senatorial dignity. The father was afterwards
  invested with the government of Lucania, and Aurelian, who soon admitted
  the abdicated monarch to his friendship and conversation, familiarly asked
  him, Whether it were not more desirable to administer a province of Italy,
  than to reign beyond the Alps. The son long continued a respectable member
  of the senate; nor was there any one of the Roman nobility more esteemed
  by Aurelian, as well as by his successors.
</p>
<p>
  So long and so various was the pomp of Aurelian’s triumph, that although
  it opened with the dawn of day, the slow majesty of the procession
  ascended not the Capitol before the ninth hour; and it was already dark
  when the emperor returned to the palace. The festival was protracted by
  theatrical representations, the games of the circus, the hunting of wild
  beasts, combats of gladiators, and naval engagements. Liberal donatives
  were distributed to the army and people, and several institutions,
  agreeable or beneficial to the city, contributed to perpetuate the glory
  of Aurelian. A considerable portion of his oriental spoils was consecrated
  to the gods of Rome; the Capitol, and every other temple, glittered with
  the offerings of his ostentatious piety; and the temple of the Sun alone
  received above fifteen thousand pounds of gold. This last was a
  magnificent structure, erected by the emperor on the side of the Quirinal
  hill, and dedicated, soon after the triumph, to that deity whom Aurelian
  adored as the parent of his life and fortunes. His mother had been an
  inferior priestess in a chapel of the Sun; a peculiar devotion to the god
  of Light was a sentiment which the fortunate peasant imbibed in his
  infancy; and every step of his elevation, every victory of his reign,
  fortified superstition by gratitude.
</p>
<p>
  The arms of Aurelian had vanquished the foreign and domestic foes of the
  republic. We are assured, that, by his salutary rigor, crimes and
  factions, mischievous arts and pernicious connivance, the luxurious growth
  of a feeble and oppressive government, were eradicated throughout the
  Roman world. But if we attentively reflect how much swifter is the
  progress of corruption than its cure, and if we remember that the years
  abandoned to public disorders exceeded the months allotted to the martial
  reign of Aurelian, we must confess that a few short intervals of peace
  were insufficient for the arduous work of reformation. Even his attempt to
  restore the integrity of the coin was opposed by a formidable
  insurrection. The emperor’s vexation breaks out in one of his private
  letters. “Surely,” says he, “the gods have decreed that my life should be
  a perpetual warfare. A sedition within the walls has just now given birth
  to a very serious civil war. The workmen of the mint, at the instigation
  of Felicissimus, a slave to whom I had intrusted an employment in the
  finances, have risen in rebellion. They are at length suppressed; but
  seven thousand of my soldiers have been slain in the contest, of those
  troops whose ordinary station is in Dacia, and the camps along the
  Danube.” Other writers, who confirm the same fact, add likewise, that it
  happened soon after Aurelian’s triumph; that the decisive engagement was
  fought on the Cælian hill; that the workmen of the mint had
  adulterated the coin; and that the emperor restored the public credit, by
  delivering out good money in exchange for the bad, which the people was
  commanded to bring into the treasury.
</p>
<p>
  We might content ourselves with relating this extraordinary transaction,
  but we cannot dissemble how much in its present form it appears to us
  inconsistent and incredible. The debasement of the coin is indeed well
  suited to the administration of Gallienus; nor is it unlikely that the
  instruments of the corruption might dread the inflexible justice of
  Aurelian. But the guilt, as well as the profit, must have been confined to
  a very few; nor is it easy to conceive by what arts they could arm a
  people whom they had injured, against a monarch whom they had betrayed. We
  might naturally expect that such miscreants should have shared the public
  detestation with the informers and the other ministers of oppression; and
  that the reformation of the coin should have been an action equally
  popular with the destruction of those obsolete accounts, which by the
  emperor’s order were burnt in the forum of Trajan. In an age when the
  principles of commerce were so imperfectly understood, the most desirable
  end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious means; but a
  temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely excite and support a
  serious civil war. The repetition of intolerable taxes, imposed either on
  the land or on the necessaries of life, may at last provoke those who will
  not, or who cannot, relinquish their country. But the case is far
  otherwise in every operation which, by whatsoever expedients, restores the
  just value of money. The transient evil is soon obliterated by the
  permanent benefit, the loss is divided among multitudes; and if a few
  wealthy individuals experience a sensible diminution of treasure, with
  their riches, they at the same time lose the degree of weight and
  importance which they derived from the possession of them. However
  Aurelian might choose to disguise the real cause of the insurrection, his
  reformation of the coin could furnish only a faint pretence to a party
  already powerful and discontented. Rome, though deprived of freedom, was
  distracted by faction. The people, towards whom the emperor, himself a
  plebeian, always expressed a peculiar fondness, lived in perpetual
  dissension with the senate, the equestrian order, and the Prætorian
  guards. Nothing less than the firm though secret conspiracy of those
  orders, of the authority of the first, the wealth of the second, and the
  arms of the third, could have displayed a strength capable of contending
  in battle with the veteran legions of the Danube, which, under the conduct
  of a martial sovereign, had achieved the conquest of the West and of the
  East.
</p>
<p>
  Whatever was the cause or the object of this rebellion, imputed with so
  little probability to the workmen of the mint, Aurelian used his victory
  with unrelenting rigor. He was naturally of a severe disposition. A
  peasant and a soldier, his nerves yielded not easily to the impressions of
  sympathy, and he could sustain without emotion the sight of tortures and
  death. Trained from his earliest youth in the exercise of arms, he set too
  small a value on the life of a citizen, chastised by military execution
  the slightest offences, and transferred the stern discipline of the camp
  into the civil administration of the laws. His love of justice often
  became a blind and furious passion; and whenever he deemed his own or the
  public safety endangered, he disregarded the rules of evidence, and the
  proportion of punishments. The unprovoked rebellion with which the Romans
  rewarded his services, exasperated his haughty spirit. The noblest
  families of the capital were involved in the guilt or suspicion of this
  dark conspiracy. A nasty spirit of revenge urged the bloody prosecution,
  and it proved fatal to one of the nephews of the emperor. The executioners
  (if we may use the expression of a contemporary poet) were fatigued, the
  prisons were crowded, and the unhappy senate lamented the death or absence
  of its most illustrious members. Nor was the pride of Aurelian less
  offensive to that assembly than his cruelty. Ignorant or impatient of the
  restraints of civil institutions, he disdained to hold his power by any
  other title than that of the sword, and governed by right of conquest an
  empire which he had saved and subdued.
</p>
<p>
  It was observed by one of the most sagacious of the Roman princes, that
  the talents of his predecessor Aurelian were better suited to the command
  of an army, than to the government of an empire. Conscious of the
  character in which nature and experience had enabled him to excel, he
  again took the field a few months after his triumph. It was expedient to
  exercise the restless temper of the legions in some foreign war, and the
  Persian monarch, exulting in the shame of Valerian, still braved with
  impunity the offended majesty of Rome. At the head of an army, less
  formidable by its numbers than by its discipline and valor, the emperor
  advanced as far as the Straits which divide Europe from Asia. He there
  experienced that the most absolute power is a weak defence against the
  effects of despair. He had threatened one of his secretaries who was
  accused of extortion; and it was known that he seldom threatened in vain.
  The last hope which remained for the criminal was to involve some of the
  principal officers of the army in his danger, or at least in his fears.
  Artfully counterfeiting his master’s hand, he showed them, in a long and
  bloody list, their own names devoted to death. Without suspecting or
  examining the fraud, they resolved to secure their lives by the murder of
  the emperor. On his march, between Byzantium and Heraclea, Aurelian was
  suddenly attacked by the conspirators, whose stations gave them a right to
  surround his person, and after a short resistance, fell by the hand of
  Mucapor, a general whom he had always loved and trusted. He died regretted
  by the army, detested by the senate, but universally acknowledged as a
  warlike and fortunate prince, the useful, though severe reformer of a
  degenerate state.

</h2>
<pre>Conduct Of The Army And Senate After The Death Of Aurelian.—Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus, And His Sons.<br>
</pre>
<p>
  Such was the unhappy condition of the Roman emperors, that, whatever
  might be their conduct, their fate was commonly the same. A life of
  pleasure or virtue, of severity or mildness, of indolence or glory, alike
  led to an untimely grave; and almost every reign is closed by the same
  disgusting repetition of treason and murder. The death of Aurelian,
  however, is remarkable by its extraordinary consequences. The legions
  admired, lamented, and revenged their victorious chief. The artifice of
  his perfidious secretary was discovered and punished. The deluded
  conspirators attended the funeral of their injured sovereign, with
  sincere or well-feigned contrition, and submitted to the unanimous
  resolution of the military order, which was signified by the following
  epistle: “The brave and fortunate armies to the senate and people of
  Rome.—The crime of one man, and the error of many, have deprived us
  of the late emperor Aurelian. May it please you, venerable lords and
  fathers! to place him in the number of the gods, and to appoint a
  successor whom your judgment shall declare worthy of the Imperial purple!
  None of those whose guilt or misfortune have contributed to our loss,
  shall ever reign over us.” The Roman senators heard, without surprise,
  that another emperor had been assassinated in his camp; they secretly
  rejoiced in the fall of Aurelian; but the modest and dutiful address of
  the legions, when it was communicated in full assembly by the consul,
  diffused the most pleasing astonishment. Such honors as fear and perhaps
  esteem could extort, they liberally poured forth on the memory of their
  deceased sovereign. Such acknowledgments as gratitude could inspire, they
  returned to the faithful armies of the republic, who entertained so just
  a sense of the legal authority of the senate in the choice of an emperor.
  Yet, notwithstanding this flattering appeal, the most prudent of the
  assembly declined exposing their safety and dignity to the caprice of an
  armed multitude. The strength of the legions was, indeed, a pledge of
  their sincerity, since those who may command are seldom reduced to the
  necessity of dissembling; but could it naturally be expected, that a
  hasty repentance would correct the inveterate habits of fourscore years?
  Should the soldiers relapse into their accustomed seditions, their
  insolence might disgrace the majesty of the senate, and prove fatal to
  the object of its choice. Motives like these dictated a decree, by which
  the election of a new emperor was referred to the suffrage of the
  military order.
</p>
<p>
  The contention that ensued is one of the best attested, but most
  improbable events in the history of mankind. The troops, as if satiated
  with the exercise of power, again conjured the senate to invest one of its
  own body with the Imperial purple. The senate still persisted in its
  refusal; the army in its request. The reciprocal offer was pressed and
  rejected at least three times, and, whilst the obstinate modesty of either
  party was resolved to receive a master from the hands of the other, eight
  months insensibly elapsed; an amazing period of tranquil anarchy, during
  which the Roman world remained without a sovereign, without a usurper, and
  without a sedition. * The generals and magistrates appointed by Aurelian
  continued to execute their ordinary functions; and it is observed, that a
  proconsul of Asia was the only considerable person removed from his office
  in the whole course of the interregnum.
</p>
<p>
  An event somewhat similar, but much less authentic, is supposed to have
  happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and character, bore
  some affinity with Aurelian. The throne was vacant during twelve months,
  till the election of a Sabine philosopher, and the public peace was
  guarded in the same manner, by the union of the several orders of the
  state. But, in the time of Numa and Romulus, the arms of the people were
  controlled by the authority of the Patricians; and the balance of freedom
  was easily preserved in a small and virtuous community. The decline of the
  Roman state, far different from its infancy, was attended with every
  circumstance that could banish from an interregnum the prospect of
  obedience and harmony: an immense and tumultuous capital, a wide extent of
  empire, the servile equality of despotism, an army of four hundred
  thousand mercenaries, and the experience of frequent revolutions. Yet,
  notwithstanding all these temptations, the discipline and memory of
  Aurelian still restrained the seditious temper of the troops, as well as
  the fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions maintained
  their stations on the banks of the Bosphorus, and the Imperial standard
  awed the less powerful camps of Rome and of the provinces. A generous
  though transient enthusiasm seemed to animate the military order; and we
  may hope that a few real patriots cultivated the returning friendship of
  the army and the senate as the only expedient capable of restoring the
  republic to its ancient beauty and vigor.
</p>
<p>
  On the twenty-fifth of September, near eight months after the murder of
  Aurelian, the consul convoked an assembly of the senate, and reported the
  doubtful and dangerous situation of the empire. He slightly insinuated,
  that the precarious loyalty of the soldiers depended on the chance of
  every hour, and of every accident; but he represented, with the most
  convincing eloquence, the various dangers that might attend any further
  delay in the choice of an emperor. Intelligence, he said, was already
  received, that the Germans had passed the Rhine, and occupied some of the
  strongest and most opulent cities of Gaul. The ambition of the Persian
  king kept the East in perpetual alarms; Egypt, Africa, and Illyricum, were
  exposed to foreign and domestic arms, and the levity of Syria would prefer
  even a female sceptre to the sanctity of the Roman laws. The consul, then
  addressing himself to Tacitus, the first of the senators, required his
  opinion on the important subject of a proper candidate for the vacant
  throne.
</p>
<p>
  If we can prefer personal merit to accidental greatness, we shall esteem
  the birth of Tacitus more truly noble than that of kings. He claimed his
  descent from the philosophic historian whose writings will instruct the
  last generations of mankind. The senator Tacitus was then seventy-five
  years of age. The long period of his innocent life was adorned with wealth
  and honors. He had twice been invested with the consular dignity, and
  enjoyed with elegance and sobriety his ample patrimony of between two and
  three millions sterling. The experience of so many princes, whom he had
  esteemed or endured, from the vain follies of Elagabalus to the useful
  rigor of Aurelian, taught him to form a just estimate of the duties, the
  dangers, and the temptations of their sublime station. From the assiduous
  study of his immortal ancestor, he derived the knowledge of the Roman
  constitution, and of human nature. The voice of the people had already
  named Tacitus as the citizen the most worthy of empire. The ungrateful
  rumor reached his ears, and induced him to seek the retirement of one of
  his villas in Campania. He had passed two months in the delightful privacy
  of Baiæ, when he reluctantly obeyed the summons of the consul to
  resume his honorable place in the senate, and to assist the republic with
  his counsels on this important occasion.
</p>
<p>
  He arose to speak, when from every quarter of the house, he was saluted
  with the names of Augustus and emperor. “Tacitus Augustus, the gods
  preserve thee! we choose thee for our sovereign; to thy care we intrust
  the republic and the world. Accept the empire from the authority of the
  senate. It is due to thy rank, to thy conduct, to thy manners.” As soon as
  the tumult of acclamations subsided, Tacitus attempted to decline the
  dangerous honor, and to express his wonder, that they should elect his age
  and infirmities to succeed the martial vigor of Aurelian. “Are these
  limbs, conscript fathers! fitted to sustain the weight of armor, or to
  practise the exercises of the camp? The variety of climates, and the
  hardships of a military life, would soon oppress a feeble constitution,
  which subsists only by the most tender management. My exhausted strength
  scarcely enables me to discharge the duty of a senator; how insufficient
  would it prove to the arduous labors of war and government! Can you hope,
  that the legions will respect a weak old man, whose days have been spent
  in the shade of peace and retirement? Can you desire that I should ever
  find reason to regret the favorable opinion of the senate?”
</p>
<p>
  The reluctance of Tacitus (and it might possibly be sincere) was
  encountered by the affectionate obstinacy of the senate. Five hundred
  voices repeated at once, in eloquent confusion, that the greatest of the
  Roman princes, Numa, Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, had ascended the
  throne in a very advanced season of life; that the mind, not the body, a
  sovereign, not a soldier, was the object of their choice; and that they
  expected from him no more than to guide by his wisdom the valor of the
  legions. These pressing though tumultuary instances were seconded by a
  more regular oration of Metius Falconius, the next on the consular bench
  to Tacitus himself. He reminded the assembly of the evils which Rome had
  endured from the vices of headstrong and capricious youths, congratulated
  them on the election of a virtuous and experienced senator, and, with a
  manly, though perhaps a selfish, freedom, exhorted Tacitus to remember the
  reasons of his elevation, and to seek a successor, not in his own family,
  but in the republic. The speech of Falconius was enforced by a general
  acclamation. The emperor elect submitted to the authority of his country,
  and received the voluntary homage of his equals. The judgment of the
  senate was confirmed by the consent of the Roman people and of the Prætorian
  guards.
</p>
<p>
  The administration of Tacitus was not unworthy of his life and principles.
  A grateful servant of the senate, he considered that national council as
  the author, and himself as the subject, of the laws. He studied to heal
  the wounds which Imperial pride, civil discord, and military violence, had
  inflicted on the constitution, and to restore, at least, the image of the
  ancient republic, as it had been preserved by the policy of Augustus, and
  the virtues of Trajan and the Antonines. It may not be useless to
  recapitulate some of the most important prerogatives which the senate
  appeared to have regained by the election of Tacitus. 1. To invest one of
  their body, under the title of emperor, with the general command of the
  armies, and the government of the frontier provinces. 2. To determine the
  list, or, as it was then styled, the College of Consuls. They were twelve
  in number, who, in successive pairs, each, during the space of two months,
  filled the year, and represented the dignity of that ancient office. The
  authority of the senate, in the nomination of the consuls, was exercised
  with such independent freedom, that no regard was paid to an irregular
  request of the emperor in favor of his brother Florianus. “The senate,”
  exclaimed Tacitus, with the honest transport of a patriot, “understand the
  character of a prince whom they have chosen.” 3. To appoint the proconsuls
  and presidents of the provinces, and to confer on all the magistrates
  their civil jurisdiction. 4. To receive appeals through the intermediate
  office of the præfect of the city from all the tribunals of the
  empire. 5. To give force and validity, by their decrees, to such as they
  should approve of the emperor’s edicts. 6. To these several branches of
  authority we may add some inspection over the finances, since, even in the
  stern reign of Aurelian, it was in their power to divert a part of the
  revenue from the public service.
</p>
<p>
  Circular epistles were sent, without delay, to all the principal cities of
  the empire, Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Thessalonica, Corinth, Athens,
  Antioch, Alexandria, and Carthage, to claim their obedience, and to inform
  them of the happy revolution, which had restored the Roman senate to its
  ancient dignity. Two of these epistles are still extant. We likewise
  possess two very singular fragments of the private correspondence of the
  senators on this occasion. They discover the most excessive joy, and the
  most unbounded hopes. “Cast away your indolence,” it is thus that one of
  the senators addresses his friend, “emerge from your retirements of Baiæ
  and Puteoli. Give yourself to the city, to the senate. Rome flourishes,
  the whole republic flourishes. Thanks to the Roman army, to an army truly
  Roman; at length we have recovered our just authority, the end of all our
  desires. We hear appeals, we appoint proconsuls, we create emperors;
  perhaps too we may restrain them—to the wise a word is sufficient.”
  These lofty expectations were, however, soon disappointed; nor, indeed,
  was it possible that the armies and the provinces should long obey the
  luxurious and unwarlike nobles of Rome. On the slightest touch, the
  unsupported fabric of their pride and power fell to the ground. The
  expiring senate displayed a sudden lustre, blazed for a moment, and was
  extinguished forever.
</p>
<p>
  All that had yet passed at Rome was no more than a theatrical
  representation, unless it was ratified by the more substantial power of
  the legions. Leaving the senators to enjoy their dream of freedom and
  ambition, Tacitus proceeded to the Thracian camp, and was there, by the Prætorian
  præfect, presented to the assembled troops, as the prince whom they
  themselves had demanded, and whom the senate had bestowed. As soon as the
  præfect was silent, the emperor addressed himself to the soldiers
  with eloquence and propriety. He gratified their avarice by a liberal
  distribution of treasure, under the names of pay and donative. He engaged
  their esteem by a spirited declaration, that although his age might
  disable him from the performance of military exploits, his counsels should
  never be unworthy of a Roman general, the successor of the brave Aurelian.
</p>
<p>
  Whilst the deceased emperor was making preparations for a second
  expedition into the East, he had negotiated with the Alani, * a Scythian
  people, who pitched their tents in the neighborhood of the Lake Mæotis.
  Those barbarians, allured by presents and subsidies, had promised to
  invade Persia with a numerous body of light cavalry. They were faithful to
  their engagements; but when they arrived on the Roman frontier, Aurelian
  was already dead, the design of the Persian war was at least suspended,
  and the generals, who, during the interregnum, exercised a doubtful
  authority, were unprepared either to receive or to oppose them. Provoked
  by such treatment, which they considered as trifling and perfidious, the
  Alani had recourse to their own valor for their payment and revenge; and
  as they moved with the usual swiftness of Tartars, they had soon spread
  themselves over the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Galatia.
  The legions, who from the opposite shores of the Bosphorus could almost
  distinguish the flames of the cities and villages, impatiently urged their
  general to lead them against the invaders. The conduct of Tacitus was
  suitable to his age and station. He convinced the barbarians of the faith,
  as well as the power, of the empire. Great numbers of the Alani, appeased
  by the punctual discharge of the engagements which Aurelian had contracted
  with them, relinquished their booty and captives, and quietly retreated to
  their own deserts, beyond the Phasis. Against the remainder, who refused
  peace, the Roman emperor waged, in person, a successful war. Seconded by
  an army of brave and experienced veterans, in a few weeks he delivered the
  provinces of Asia from the terror of the Scythian invasion.
</p>
<p>
  But the glory and life of Tacitus were of short duration. Transported, in
  the depth of winter, from the soft retirement of Campania to the foot of
  Mount Caucasus, he sunk under the unaccustomed hardships of a military
  life. The fatigues of the body were aggravated by the cares of the mind.
  For a while, the angry and selfish passions of the soldiers had been
  suspended by the enthusiasm of public virtue. They soon broke out with
  redoubled violence, and raged in the camp, and even in the tent of the
  aged emperor. His mild and amiable character served only to inspire
  contempt, and he was incessantly tormented with factions which he could
  not assuage, and by demands which it was impossible to satisfy. Whatever
  flattering expectations he had conceived of reconciling the public
  disorders, Tacitus soon was convinced that the licentiousness of the army
  disdained the feeble restraint of laws, and his last hour was hastened by
  anguish and disappointment. It may be doubtful whether the soldiers
  imbrued their hands in the blood of this innocent prince. It is certain
  that their insolence was the cause of his death. He expired at Tyana in
  Cappadocia, after a reign of only six months and about twenty days.
</p>
<p>
  The eyes of Tacitus were scarcely closed, before his brother Florianus
  showed himself unworthy to reign, by the hasty usurpation of the purple,
  without expecting the approbation of the senate. The reverence for the
  Roman constitution, which yet influenced the camp and the provinces, was
  sufficiently strong to dispose them to censure, but not to provoke them to
  oppose, the precipitate ambition of Florianus. The discontent would have
  evaporated in idle murmurs, had not the general of the East, the heroic
  Probus, boldly declared himself the avenger of the senate. The contest,
  however, was still unequal; nor could the most able leader, at the head of
  the effeminate troops of Egypt and Syria, encounter, with any hopes of
  victory, the legions of Europe, whose irresistible strength appeared to
  support the brother of Tacitus. But the fortune and activity of Probus
  triumphed over every obstacle. The hardy veterans of his rival, accustomed
  to cold climates, sickened and consumed away in the sultry heats of
  Cilicia, where the summer proved remarkably unwholesome. Their numbers
  were diminished by frequent desertion; the passes of the mountains were
  feebly defended; Tarsus opened its gates; and the soldiers of Florianus,
  when they had permitted him to enjoy the Imperial title about three
  months, delivered the empire from civil war by the easy sacrifice of a
  prince whom they despised.
</p>
<p>
  The perpetual revolutions of the throne had so perfectly erased every
  notion of hereditary title, that the family of an unfortunate emperor was
  incapable of exciting the jealousy of his successors. The children of
  Tacitus and Florianus were permitted to descend into a private station,
  and to mingle with the general mass of the people. Their poverty indeed
  became an additional safeguard to their innocence. When Tacitus was
  elected by the senate, he resigned his ample patrimony to the public
  service; an act of generosity specious in appearance, but which evidently
  disclosed his intention of transmitting the empire to his descendants. The
  only consolation of their fallen state was the remembrance of transient
  greatness, and a distant hope, the child of a flattering prophecy, that at
  the end of a thousand years, a monarch of the race of Tacitus should
  arise, the protector of the senate, the restorer of Rome, and the
  conqueror of the whole earth.
</p>
<p>
  The peasants of Illyricum, who had already given Claudius and Aurelian to
  the sinking empire, had an equal right to glory in the elevation of
  Probus. Above twenty years before, the emperor Valerian, with his usual
  penetration, had discovered the rising merit of the young soldier, on whom
  he conferred the rank of tribune, long before the age prescribed by the
  military regulations. The tribune soon justified his choice, by a victory
  over a great body of Sarmatians, in which he saved the life of a near
  relation of Valerian; and deserved to receive from the emperor’s hand the
  collars, bracelets, spears, and banners, the mural and the civic crown,
  and all the honorable rewards reserved by ancient Rome for successful
  valor. The third, and afterwards the tenth, legion were intrusted to the
  command of Probus, who, in every step of his promotion, showed himself
  superior to the station which he filled. Africa and Pontus, the Rhine, the
  Danube, the Euphrates, and the Nile, by turns afforded him the most
  splendid occasions of displaying his personal prowess and his conduct in
  war. Aurelian was indebted for the honest courage with which he often
  checked the cruelty of his master. Tacitus, who desired by the abilities
  of his generals to supply his own deficiency of military talents, named
  him commander-in-chief of all the eastern provinces, with five times the
  usual salary, the promise of the consulship, and the hope of a triumph.
  When Probus ascended the Imperial throne, he was about forty-four years of
  age; in the full possession of his fame, of the love of the army, and of a
  mature vigor of mind and body.
</p>
<p>
  His acknowledged merit, and the success of his arms against Florianus, left
  him without an enemy or a competitor. Yet, if we may credit his own
  professions, very far from being desirous of the empire, he had accepted
  it with the most sincere reluctance. “But it is no longer in my power,”
  says Probus, in a private letter, “to lay down a title so full of envy and
  of danger. I must continue to personate the character which the soldiers
  have imposed upon me.” His dutiful address to the senate displayed the
  sentiments, or at least the language, of a Roman patriot: “When you
  elected one of your order, conscript fathers! to succeed the emperor
  Aurelian, you acted in a manner suitable to your justice and wisdom. For
  you are the legal sovereigns of the world, and the power which you derive
  from your ancestors will descend to your posterity. Happy would it have
  been, if Florianus, instead of usurping the purple of his brother, like a
  private inheritance, had expected what your majesty might determine,
  either in his favor, or in that of any other person. The prudent soldiers have
  punished his rashness. To me they have offered the title of Augustus. But
  I submit to your clemency my pretensions and my merits.” When this
  respectful epistle was read by the consul, the senators were unable to
  disguise their satisfaction, that Probus should condescend thus humbly to
  solicit a sceptre which he already possessed. They celebrated with the
  warmest gratitude his virtues, his exploits, and above all his moderation.
  A decree immediately passed, without a dissenting voice, to ratify the
  election of the eastern armies, and to confer on their chief all the
  several branches of the Imperial dignity: the names of Cæsar and
  Augustus, the title of Father of his country, the right of making in the
  same day three motions in the senate, the office of Pontifex Maximus, the
  tribunitian power, and the proconsular command; a mode of investiture,
  which, though it seemed to multiply the authority of the emperor,
  expressed the constitution of the ancient republic. The reign of Probus
  corresponded with this fair beginning. The senate was permitted to direct
  the civil administration of the empire. Their faithful general asserted
  the honor of the Roman arms, and often laid at their feet crowns of gold
  and barbaric trophies, the fruits of his numerous victories. Yet, whilst
  he gratified their vanity, he must secretly have despised their indolence
  and weakness. Though it was every moment in their power to repeal the
  disgraceful edict of Gallienus, the proud successors of the Scipios
  patiently acquiesced in their exclusion from all military employments.
  They soon experienced, that those who refuse the sword must renounce the
  sceptre.

  Chapter XII: Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus And His Sons.—Part II.
</h2>
<p>
  The strength of Aurelian had crushed on every side the enemies of Rome.
  After his death they seemed to revive with an increase of fury and of
  numbers. They were again vanquished by the active vigor of Probus, who, in
  a short reign of about six years, equalled the fame of ancient heroes, and
  restored peace and order to every province of the Roman world. The
  dangerous frontier of Rhætia he so firmly secured, that he left it
  without the suspicion of an enemy. He broke the wandering power of the
  Sarmatian tribes, and by the terror of his arms compelled those barbarians
  to relinquish their spoil. The Gothic nation courted the alliance of so
  warlike an emperor. He attacked the Isaurians in their mountains, besieged
  and took several of their strongest castles, and flattered himself that he
  had forever suppressed a domestic foe, whose independence so deeply
  wounded the majesty of the empire. The troubles excited by the usurper
  Firmus in the Upper Egypt had never been perfectly appeased, and the
  cities of Ptolemais and Coptos, fortified by the alliance of the Blemmyes,
  still maintained an obscure rebellion. The chastisement of those cities,
  and of their auxiliaries the savages of the South, is said to have alarmed
  the court of Persia, and the Great King sued in vain for the friendship of
  Probus. Most of the exploits which distinguished his reign were achieved
  by the personal valor and conduct of the emperor, insomuch that the writer
  of his life expresses some amazement how, in so short a time, a single man
  could be present in so many distant wars. The remaining actions he
  intrusted to the care of his lieutenants, the judicious choice of whom
  forms no inconsiderable part of his glory. Carus, Diocletian, Maximian,
  Constantius, Galerius, Asclepiodatus, Annibalianus, and a crowd of other
  chiefs, who afterwards ascended or supported the throne, were trained to
  arms in the severe school of Aurelian and Probus.
</p>
<p>
  But the most important service which Probus rendered to the republic was
  the deliverance of Gaul, and the recovery of seventy flourishing cities
  oppressed by the barbarians of Germany, who, since the death of Aurelian,
  had ravaged that great province with impunity. Among the various multitude
  of those fierce invaders we may distinguish, with some degree of
  clearness, three great armies, or rather nations, successively vanquished
  by the valor of Probus. He drove back the Franks into their morasses; a
  descriptive circumstance from whence we may infer, that the confederacy
  known by the manly appellation of <i>Free</i>, already occupied the flat
  maritime country, intersected and almost overflown by the stagnating
  waters of the Rhine, and that several tribes of the Frisians and Batavians
  had acceded to their alliance. He vanquished the Burgundians, a
  considerable people of the Vandalic race. * They had wandered in quest of
  booty from the banks of the Oder to those of the Seine. They esteemed
  themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase, by the restitution of all
  their booty, the permission of an undisturbed retreat. They attempted to
  elude that article of the treaty. Their punishment was immediate and
  terrible. But of all the invaders of Gaul, the most formidable were the
  Lygians, a distant people, who reigned over a wide domain on the frontiers
  of Poland and Silesia. In the Lygian nation, the Arii held the first rank
  by their numbers and fierceness. “The Arii” (it is thus that they are
  described by the energy of Tacitus) “study to improve by art and
  circumstances the innate terrors of their barbarism. Their shields are
  black, their bodies are painted black. They choose for the combat the
  darkest hour of the night. Their host advances, covered as it were with a
  funeral shade; nor do they often find an enemy capable of sustaining so
  strange and infernal an aspect. Of all our senses, the eyes are the first
  vanquished in battle.” Yet the arms and discipline of the Romans easily
  discomfited these horrid phantoms. The Lygii were defeated in a general
  engagement, and Semno, the most renowned of their chiefs, fell alive into
  the hands of Probus. That prudent emperor, unwilling to reduce a brave
  people to despair, granted them an honorable capitulation, and permitted
  them to return in safety to their native country. But the losses which
  they suffered in the march, the battle, and the retreat, broke the power
  of the nation: nor is the Lygian name ever repeated in the history either
  of Germany or of the empire. The deliverance of Gaul is reported to have
  cost the lives of four hundred thousand of the invaders; a work of labor
  to the Romans, and of expense to the emperor, who gave a piece of gold for
  the head of every barbarian. But as the fame of warriors is built on the
  destruction of human kind, we may naturally suspect that the sanguinary
  account was multiplied by the avarice of the soldiers, and accepted
  without any very severe examination by the liberal vanity of Probus.
</p>
<p>
  Since the expedition of Maximin, the Roman generals had confined their
  ambition to a defensive war against the nations of Germany, who
  perpetually pressed on the frontiers of the empire. The more daring Probus
  pursued his Gallic victories, passed the Rhine, and displayed his
  invincible eagles on the banks of the Elbe and the Neckar. He was fully
  convinced that nothing could reconcile the minds of the barbarians to
  peace, unless they experienced, in their own country, the calamities of
  war. Germany, exhausted by the ill success of the last emigration, was
  astonished by his presence. Nine of the most considerable princes repaired
  to his camp, and fell prostrate at his feet. Such a treaty was humbly
  received by the Germans, as it pleased the conqueror to dictate. He
  exacted a strict restitution of the effects and captives which they had
  carried away from the provinces; and obliged their own magistrates to
  punish the more obstinate robbers who presumed to detain any part of the
  spoil. A considerable tribute of corn, cattle, and horses, the only wealth
  of barbarians, was reserved for the use of the garrisons which Probus
  established on the limits of their territory. He even entertained some
  thoughts of compelling the Germans to relinquish the exercise of arms, and
  to trust their differences to the justice, their safety to the power, of
  Rome. To accomplish these salutary ends, the constant residence of an
  Imperial governor, supported by a numerous army, was indispensably
  requisite. Probus therefore judged it more expedient to defer the
  execution of so great a design; which was indeed rather of specious than
  solid utility. Had Germany been reduced into the state of a province, the
  Romans, with immense labor and expense, would have acquired only a more
  extensive boundary to defend against the fiercer and more active
  barbarians of Scythia.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of reducing the warlike natives of Germany to the condition of
  subjects, Probus contented himself with the humble expedient of raising a
  bulwark against their inroads. The country which now forms the circle of
  Swabia had been left desert in the age of Augustus by the emigration of
  its ancient inhabitants. The fertility of the soil soon attracted a new
  colony from the adjacent provinces of Gaul. Crowds of adventurers, of a
  roving temper and of desperate fortunes, occupied the doubtful possession,
  and acknowledged, by the payment of tithes, the majesty of the empire. To
  protect these new subjects, a line of frontier garrisons was gradually
  extended from the Rhine to the Danube. About the reign of Hadrian, when
  that mode of defence began to be practised, these garrisons were connected
  and covered by a strong intrenchment of trees and palisades. In the place
  of so rude a bulwark, the emperor Probus constructed a stone wall of a
  considerable height, and strengthened it by towers at convenient
  distances. From the neighborhood of Neustadt and Ratisbon on the Danube,
  it stretched across hills, valleys, rivers, and morasses, as far as
  Wimpfen on the Neckar, and at length terminated on the banks of the Rhine,
  after a winding course of near two hundred miles. This important barrier,
  uniting the two mighty streams that protected the provinces of Europe,
  seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the barbarians, and
  particularly the Alemanni, could penetrate with the greatest facility into
  the heart of the empire. But the experience of the world, from China to
  Britain, has exposed the vain attempt of fortifying any extensive tract of
  country. An active enemy, who can select and vary his points of attack,
  must, in the end, discover some feeble spot, or some unguarded moment. The
  strength, as well as the attention, of the defenders is divided; and such
  are the blind effects of terror on the firmest troops, that a line broken
  in a single place is almost instantly deserted. The fate of the wall which
  Probus erected may confirm the general observation. Within a few years
  after his death, it was overthrown by the Alemanni. Its scattered ruins,
  universally ascribed to the power of the Dæmon, now serve only to
  excite the wonder of the Swabian peasant.
</p>
<p>
  Among the useful conditions of peace imposed by Probus on the vanquished
  nations of Germany, was the obligation of supplying the Roman army with
  sixteen thousand recruits, the bravest and most robust of their youth. The
  emperor dispersed them through all the provinces, and distributed this
  dangerous reënforcement, in small bands of fifty or sixty each, among the
  national troops; judiciously observing, that the aid which the republic
  derived from the barbarians should be felt but not seen. Their aid was now
  become necessary. The feeble elegance of Italy and the internal provinces
  could no longer support the weight of arms. The hardy frontiers of the
  Rhine and Danube still produced minds and bodies equal to the labors of
  the camp; but a perpetual series of wars had gradually diminished their
  numbers. The infrequency of marriage, and the ruin of agriculture,
  affected the principles of population, and not only destroyed the strength
  of the present, but intercepted the hope of future, generations. The
  wisdom of Probus embraced a great and beneficial plan of replenishing the
  exhausted frontiers, by new colonies of captive or fugitive barbarians, on
  whom he bestowed lands, cattle, instruments of husbandry, and every
  encouragement that might engage them to educate a race of soldiers for the
  service of the republic. Into Britain, and most probably into
  Cambridgeshire, he transported a considerable body of Vandals. The
  impossibility of an escape reconciled them to their situation, and in the
  subsequent troubles of that island, they approved themselves the most
  faithful servants of the state. Great numbers of Franks and Gepidæ
  were settled on the banks of the Danube and the Rhine. A hundred thousand
  Bastarnæ, expelled from their own country, cheerfully accepted an
  establishment in Thrace, and soon imbibed the manners and sentiments of
  Roman subjects. But the expectations of Probus were too often
  disappointed. The impatience and idleness of the barbarians could ill
  brook the slow labors of agriculture. Their unconquerable love of freedom,
  rising against despotism, provoked them into hasty rebellions, alike fatal
  to themselves and to the provinces; nor could these artificial supplies,
  however repeated by succeeding emperors, restore the important limit of
  Gaul and Illyricum to its ancient and native vigor.
</p>
<p>
  Of all the barbarians who abandoned their new settlements, and disturbed
  the public tranquillity, a very small number returned to their own
  country. For a short season they might wander in arms through the empire;
  but in the end they were surely destroyed by the power of a warlike
  emperor. The successful rashness of a party of Franks was attended,
  however, with such memorable consequences, that it ought not to be passed
  unnoticed. They had been established by Probus, on the sea-coast of
  Pontus, with a view of strengthening the frontier against the inroads of
  the Alani. A fleet stationed in one of the harbors of the Euxine fell into
  the hands of the Franks; and they resolved, through unknown seas, to
  explore their way from the mouth of the Phasis to that of the Rhine. They
  easily escaped through the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, and cruising
  along the Mediterranean, indulged their appetite for revenge and plunder
  by frequent descents on the unsuspecting shores of Asia, Greece, and
  Africa. The opulent city of Syracuse, in whose port the natives of Athens
  and Carthage had formerly been sunk, was sacked by a handful of
  barbarians, who massacred the greatest part of the trembling inhabitants.
  From the island of Sicily the Franks proceeded to the columns of
  Hercules, trusted themselves to the ocean, coasted round Spain and Gaul,
  and steering their triumphant course through the British Channel, at
  length finished their surprising voyage, by landing in safety on the
  Batavian or Frisian shores. The example of their success, instructing
  their countrymen to conceive the advantages and to despise the dangers of
  the sea, pointed out to their enterprising spirit a new road to wealth and
  glory.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding the vigilance and activity of Probus, it was almost
  impossible that he could at once contain in obedience every part of his
  wide-extended dominions. The barbarians, who broke their chains, had
  seized the favorable opportunity of a domestic war. When the emperor
  marched to the relief of Gaul, he devolved the command of the East on
  Saturninus. That general, a man of merit and experience, was driven into
  rebellion by the absence of his sovereign, the levity of the Alexandrian
  people, the pressing instances of his friends, and his own fears; but from
  the moment of his elevation, he never entertained a hope of empire, or
  even of life. “Alas!” he said, “the republic has lost a useful servant,
  and the rashness of an hour has destroyed the services of many years. You
  know not,” continued he, “the misery of sovereign power; a sword is
  perpetually suspended over our head. We dread our very guards, we distrust
  our companions. The choice of action or of repose is no longer in our
  disposition, nor is there any age, or character, or conduct, that can
  protect us from the censure of envy. In thus exalting me to the throne,
  you have doomed me to a life of cares, and to an untimely fate. The only
  consolation which remains is the assurance that I shall not fall alone.”
  But as the former part of his prediction was verified by the victory, so
  the latter was disappointed by the clemency, of Probus. That amiable prince
  attempted even to save the unhappy Saturninus from the fury of the
  soldiers. He had more than once solicited the usurper himself to place
  some confidence in the mercy of a sovereign who so highly esteemed his
  character, that he had punished, as a malicious informer, the first who
  related the improbable news of his disaffection. Saturninus might,
  perhaps, have embraced the generous offer, had he not been restrained by
  the obstinate distrust of his adherents. Their guilt was deeper, and their
  hopes more sanguine, than those of their experienced leader.
</p>
<p>
  The revolt of Saturninus was scarcely extinguished in the East, before new
  troubles were excited in the West, by the rebellion of Bonosus and
  Proculus, in Gaul. The most distinguished merit of those two officers was
  their respective prowess, of the one in the combats of Bacchus, of the
  other in those of Venus, yet neither of them was destitute of courage and
  capacity, and both sustained, with honor, the august character which the
  fear of punishment had engaged them to assume, till they sunk at length
  beneath the superior genius of Probus. He used the victory with his
  accustomed moderation, and spared the fortune, as well as the lives of
  their innocent families.
</p>
<p>
  The arms of Probus had now suppressed all the foreign and domestic enemies
  of the state. His mild but steady administration confirmed the
  re-ëstablishment of the public tranquillity; nor was there left in the
  provinces a hostile barbarian, a tyrant, or even a robber, to revive the
  memory of past disorders. It was time that the emperor should revisit
  Rome, and celebrate his own glory and the general happiness. The triumph
  due to the valor of Probus was conducted with a magnificence suitable to
  his fortune, and the people, who had so lately admired the trophies of
  Aurelian, gazed with equal pleasure on those of his heroic successor. We
  cannot, on this occasion, forget the desperate courage of about fourscore
  gladiators, reserved, with near six hundred others, for the inhuman sports
  of the amphitheatre. Disdaining to shed their blood for the amusement of
  the populace, they killed their keepers, broke from the place of their
  confinement, and filled the streets of Rome with blood and confusion.
  After an obstinate resistance, they were overpowered and cut in pieces by
  the regular forces; but they obtained at least an honorable death, and the
  satisfaction of a just revenge.
</p>
<p>
  The military discipline which reigned in the camps of Probus was less
  cruel than that of Aurelian, but it was equally rigid and exact. The
  latter had punished the irregularities of the soldiers with unrelenting
  severity, the former prevented them by employing the legions in constant
  and useful labors. When Probus commanded in Egypt, he executed many
  considerable works for the splendor and benefit of that rich country. The
  navigation of the Nile, so important to Rome itself, was improved; and
  temples, buildings, porticos, and palaces, were constructed by the hands of
  the soldiers, who acted by turns as architects, as engineers, and as
  husbandmen. It was reported of Hannibal, that, in order to preserve his
  troops from the dangerous temptations of idleness, he had obliged them to
  form large plantations of olive-trees along the coast of Africa. From a
  similar principle, Probus exercised his legions in covering with rich
  vineyards the hills of Gaul and Pannonia, and two considerable spots are
  described, which were entirely dug and planted by military labor. One of
  these, known under the name of Mount Almo, was situated near Sirmium, the
  country where Probus was born, for which he ever retained a partial
  affection, and whose gratitude he endeavored to secure, by converting into
  tillage a large and unhealthy tract of marshy ground. An army thus
  employed constituted perhaps the most useful, as well as the bravest,
  portion of Roman subjects.
</p>
<p>
  But in the prosecution of a favorite scheme, the best of men, satisfied
  with the rectitude of their intentions, are subject to forget the bounds
  of moderation; nor did Probus himself sufficiently consult the patience
  and disposition of his fierce legionaries. The dangers of the military
  profession seem only to be compensated by a life of pleasure and idleness;
  but if the duties of the soldier are incessantly aggravated by the labors
  of the peasant, he will at last sink under the intolerable burden, or
  shake it off with indignation. The imprudence of Probus is said to have
  inflamed the discontent of his troops. More attentive to the interests of
  mankind than to those of the army, he expressed the vain hope, that, by
  the establishment of universal peace, he should soon abolish the necessity
  of a standing and mercenary force. The unguarded expression proved fatal
  to him. In one of the hottest days of summer, as he severely urged the
  unwholesome labor of draining the marshes of Sirmium, the soldiers,
  impatient of fatigue, on a sudden threw down their tools, grasped their
  arms, and broke out into a furious mutiny. The emperor, conscious of his
  danger, took refuge in a lofty tower, constructed for the purpose of
  surveying the progress of the work. The tower was instantly forced, and a
  thousand swords were plunged at once into the bosom of the unfortunate
  Probus. The rage of the troops subsided as soon as it had been gratified.
  They then lamented their fatal rashness, forgot the severity of the
  emperor whom they had massacred, and hastened to perpetuate, by an
  honorable monument, the memory of his virtues and victories.
</p>
<p>
  When the legions had indulged their grief and repentance for the death of
  Probus, their unanimous consent declared Carus, his Prætorian præfect,
  the most deserving of the Imperial throne. Every circumstance that relates
  to this prince appears of a mixed and doubtful nature. He gloried in the
  title of Roman Citizen; and affected to compare the purity of his blood
  with the foreign and even barbarous origin of the preceding emperors; yet
  the most inquisitive of his contemporaries, very far from admitting his
  claim, have variously deduced his own birth, or that of his parents, from
  Illyricum, from Gaul, or from Africa. Though a soldier, he had received a
  learned education; though a senator, he was invested with the first
  dignity of the army; and in an age when the civil and military professions
  began to be irrecoverably separated from each other, they were united in
  the person of Carus. Notwithstanding the severe justice which he exercised
  against the assassins of Probus, to whose favor and esteem he was highly
  indebted, he could not escape the suspicion of being accessory to a deed
  from whence he derived the principal advantage. He enjoyed, at least
  before his elevation, an acknowledged character of virtue and abilities;
  but his austere temper insensibly degenerated into moroseness and cruelty;
  and the imperfect writers of his life almost hesitate whether they shall
  not rank him in the number of Roman tyrants. When Carus assumed the
  purple, he was about sixty years of age, and his two sons, Carinus and
  Numerian had already attained the season of manhood.
</p>
<p>
  The authority of the senate expired with Probus; nor was the repentance of
  the soldiers displayed by the same dutiful regard for the civil power,
  which they had testified after the unfortunate death of Aurelian. The
  election of Carus was decided without expecting the approbation of the
  senate, and the new emperor contented himself with announcing, in a cold
  and stately epistle, that he had ascended the vacant throne. A behavior so
  very opposite to that of his amiable predecessor afforded no favorable
  presage of the new reign: and the Romans, deprived of power and freedom,
  asserted their privilege of licentious murmurs. The voice of
  congratulation and flattery was not, however, silent; and we may still
  peruse, with pleasure and contempt, an eclogue, which was composed on the
  accession of the emperor Carus. Two shepherds, avoiding the noontide heat,
  retire into the cave of Faunus. On a spreading beech they discover some
  recent characters. The rural deity had described, in prophetic verses, the
  felicity promised to the empire under the reign of so great a prince.
  Faunus hails the approach of that hero, who, receiving on his shoulders
  the sinking weight of the Roman world, shall extinguish war and faction,
  and once again restore the innocence and security of the golden age.
</p>
<p>
  It is more than probable, that these elegant trifles never reached the
  ears of a veteran general, who, with the consent of the legions, was
  preparing to execute the long-suspended design of the Persian war. Before
  his departure for this distant expedition, Carus conferred on his two
  sons, Carinus and Numerian, the title of Cæsar, and investing the
  former with almost an equal share of the Imperial power, directed the
  young prince first to suppress some troubles which had arisen in Gaul,
  and afterwards to fix the seat of his residence at Rome, and to assume the
  government of the Western provinces. The safety of Illyricum was confirmed
  by a memorable defeat of the Sarmatians; sixteen thousand of those
  barbarians remained on the field of battle, and the number of captives
  amounted to twenty thousand. The old emperor, animated with the fame and
  prospect of victory, pursued his march, in the midst of winter, through
  the countries of Thrace and Asia Minor, and at length, with his younger
  son, Numerian, arrived on the confines of the Persian monarchy. There,
  encamping on the summit of a lofty mountain, he pointed out to his troops
  the opulence and luxury of the enemy whom they were about to invade.
</p>
<p>
  The successor of Artaxerxes, * Varanes, or Bahram, though he had subdued
  the Segestans, one of the most warlike nations of Upper Asia, was alarmed
  at the approach of the Romans, and endeavored to retard their progress by
  a negotiation of peace. His ambassadors entered the camp about sunset, at
  the time when the troops were satisfying their hunger with a frugal
  repast. The Persians expressed their desire of being introduced to the
  presence of the Roman emperor. They were at length conducted to a soldier,
  who was seated on the grass. A piece of stale bacon and a few hard peas
  composed his supper. A coarse woollen garment of purple was the only
  circumstance that announced his dignity. The conference was conducted with
  the same disregard of courtly elegance. Carus, taking off a cap which he
  wore to conceal his baldness, assured the ambassadors, that, unless their
  master acknowledged the superiority of Rome, he would speedily render
  Persia as naked of trees as his own head was destitute of hair.
  Notwithstanding some traces of art and preparation, we may discover in
  this scene the manners of Carus, and the severe simplicity which the
  martial princes, who succeeded Gallienus, had already restored in the
  Roman camps. The ministers of the Great King trembled and retired.
</p>
<p>
  The threats of Carus were not without effect. He ravaged Mesopotamia, cut
  in pieces whatever opposed his passage, made himself master of the great
  cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon, (which seemed to have surrendered
  without resistance,) and carried his victorious arms beyond the Tigris. He
  had seized the favorable moment for an invasion. The Persian councils were
  distracted by domestic factions, and the greater part of their forces were
  detained on the frontiers of India. Rome and the East received with
  transport the news of such important advantages. Flattery and hope
  painted, in the most lively colors, the fall of Persia, the conquest of
  Arabia, the submission of Egypt, and a lasting deliverance from the
  inroads of the Scythian nations. But the reign of Carus was destined to
  expose the vanity of predictions. They were scarcely uttered before they
  were contradicted by his death; an event attended with such ambiguous
  circumstances, that it may be related in a letter from his own secretary
  to the præfect of the city. “Carus,” says he, “our dearest emperor,
  was confined by sickness to his bed, when a furious tempest arose in the
  camp. The darkness which overspread the sky was so thick, that we could no
  longer distinguish each other; and the incessant flashes of lightning took
  from us the knowledge of all that passed in the general confusion.
  Immediately after the most violent clap of thunder, we heard a sudden cry
  that the emperor was dead; and it soon appeared, that his chamberlains, in
  a rage of grief, had set fire to the royal pavilion; a circumstance which
  gave rise to the report that Carus was killed by lightning. But, as far as
  we have been able to investigate the truth, his death was the natural
  effect of his disorder.”

  Chapter XII: Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus And His Sons.—Part
  III.
</h2>
<p>
  The vacancy of the throne was not productive of any disturbance. The
  ambition of the aspiring generals was checked by their natural fears, and
  young Numerian, with his absent brother Carinus, were unanimously
  acknowledged as Roman emperors. The public expected that the successor of
  Carus would pursue his father’s footsteps, and, without allowing the
  Persians to recover from their consternation, would advance sword in hand
  to the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana. But the legions, however strong in
  numbers and discipline, were dismayed by the most abject superstition.
  Notwithstanding all the arts that were practised to disguise the manner of
  the late emperor’s death, it was found impossible to remove the opinion of
  the multitude, and the power of opinion is irresistible. Places or persons
  struck with lightning were considered by the ancients with pious horror,
  as singularly devoted to the wrath of Heaven. An oracle was remembered,
  which marked the River Tigris as the fatal boundary of the Roman arms. The
  troops, terrified with the fate of Carus and with their own danger, called
  aloud on young Numerian to obey the will of the gods, and to lead them
  away from this inauspicious scene of war. The feeble emperor was unable to
  subdue their obstinate prejudice, and the Persians wondered at the
  unexpected retreat of a victorious enemy.
</p>
<p>
  The intelligence of the mysterious fate of the late emperor was soon
  carried from the frontiers of Persia to Rome; and the senate, as well as
  the provinces, congratulated the accession of the sons of Carus. These
  fortunate youths were strangers, however, to that conscious superiority,
  either of birth or of merit, which can alone render the possession of a
  throne easy, and, as it were, natural. Born and educated in a private
  station, the election of their father raised them at once to the rank of
  princes; and his death, which happened about sixteen months afterwards,
  left them the unexpected legacy of a vast empire. To sustain with temper
  this rapid elevation, an uncommon share of virtue and prudence was
  requisite; and Carinus, the elder of the brothers, was more than commonly
  deficient in those qualities. In the Gallic war he discovered some degree
  of personal courage; but from the moment of his arrival at Rome, he
  abandoned himself to the luxury of the capital, and to the abuse of his
  fortune. He was soft, yet cruel; devoted to pleasure, but destitute of
  taste; and though exquisitely susceptible of vanity, indifferent to the
  public esteem. In the course of a few months, he successively married and
  divorced nine wives, most of whom he left pregnant; and notwithstanding
  this legal inconstancy, found time to indulge such a variety of irregular
  appetites, as brought dishonor on himself and on the noblest houses of
  Rome. He beheld with inveterate hatred all those who might remember his
  former obscurity, or censure his present conduct. He banished, or put to
  death, the friends and counsellors whom his father had placed about him,
  to guide his inexperienced youth; and he persecuted with the meanest
  revenge his school-fellows and companions who had not sufficiently
  respected the latent majesty of the emperor. With the senators, Carinus
  affected a lofty and regal demeanor, frequently declaring, that he
  designed to distribute their estates among the populace of Rome. From the
  dregs of that populace he selected his favorites, and even his ministers.
  The palace, and even the Imperial table, were filled with singers,
  dancers, prostitutes, and all the various retinue of vice and folly. One
  of his doorkeepers he intrusted with the government of the city. In the
  room of the Prætorian præfect, whom he put to death, Carinus
  substituted one of the ministers of his looser pleasures. Another, who
  possessed the same, or even a more infamous, title to favor, was invested
  with the consulship. A confidential secretary, who had acquired uncommon
  skill in the art of forgery, delivered the indolent emperor, with his own
  consent from the irksome duty of signing his name.
</p>
<p>
  When the emperor Carus undertook the Persian war, he was induced, by
  motives of affection as well as policy, to secure the fortunes of his
  family, by leaving in the hands of his eldest son the armies and provinces
  of the West. The intelligence which he soon received of the conduct of
  Carinus filled him with shame and regret; nor had he concealed his
  resolution of satisfying the republic by a severe act of justice, and of
  adopting, in the place of an unworthy son, the brave and virtuous
  Constantius, who at that time was governor of Dalmatia. But the elevation
  of Constantius was for a while deferred; and as soon as the father’s death
  had released Carinus from the control of fear or decency, he displayed to
  the Romans the extravagancies of Elagabalus, aggravated by the cruelty of
  Domitian.
</p>
<p>
  The only merit of the administration of Carinus that history could record,
  or poetry celebrate, was the uncommon splendor with which, in his own and
  his brother’s name, he exhibited the Roman games of the theatre, the
  circus, and the amphitheatre. More than twenty years afterwards, when the
  courtiers of Diocletian represented to their frugal sovereign the fame and
  popularity of his munificent predecessor, he acknowledged that the reign
  of Carinus had indeed been a reign of pleasure. But this vain prodigality,
  which the prudence of Diocletian might justly despise, was enjoyed with
  surprise and transport by the Roman people. The oldest of the citizens,
  recollecting the spectacles of former days, the triumphal pomp of Probus
  or Aurelian, and the secular games of the emperor Philip, acknowledged
  that they were all surpassed by the superior magnificence of Carinus.
</p>
<p>
  The spectacles of Carinus may therefore be best illustrated by the
  observation of some particulars, which history has condescended to relate
  concerning those of his predecessors. If we confine ourselves solely to
  the hunting of wild beasts, however we may censure the vanity of the
  design or the cruelty of the execution, we are obliged to confess that
  neither before nor since the time of the Romans so much art and expense
  have ever been lavished for the amusement of the people. By the order of
  Probus, a great quantity of large trees, torn up by the roots, were
  transplanted into the midst of the circus. The spacious and shady forest
  was immediately filled with a thousand ostriches, a thousand stags, a
  thousand fallow deer, and a thousand wild boars; and all this variety of
  game was abandoned to the riotous impetuosity of the multitude. The
  tragedy of the succeeding day consisted in the massacre of a hundred
  lions, an equal number of lionesses, two hundred leopards, and three
  hundred bears. The collection prepared by the younger Gordian for his
  triumph, and which his successor exhibited in the secular games, was less
  remarkable by the number than by the singularity of the animals. Twenty
  zebras displayed their elegant forms and variegated beauty to the eyes of
  the Roman people. Ten elks, and as many camelopards, the loftiest and most
  harmless creatures that wander over the plains of Sarmatia and Æthiopia,
  were contrasted with thirty African hyænas and ten Indian tigers,
  the most implacable savages of the torrid zone. The unoffending strength
  with which Nature has endowed the greater quadrupeds was admired in the
  rhinoceros, the hippopotamus of the Nile, and a majestic troop of
  thirty-two elephants. While the populace gazed with stupid wonder on the
  splendid show, the naturalist might indeed observe the figure and
  properties of so many different species, transported from every part of
  the ancient world into the amphitheatre of Rome. But this accidental
  benefit, which science might derive from folly, is surely insufficient to
  justify such a wanton abuse of the public riches. There occurs, however, a
  single instance in the first Punic war, in which the senate wisely
  connected this amusement of the multitude with the interest of the state.
  A considerable number of elephants, taken in the defeat of the
  Carthaginian army, were driven through the circus by a few slaves, armed
  only with blunt javelins. The useful spectacle served to impress the Roman
  soldier with a just contempt for those unwieldy animals; and he no longer
  dreaded to encounter them in the ranks of war.
</p>
<p>
  The hunting or exhibition of wild beasts was conducted with a magnificence
  suitable to a people who styled themselves the masters of the world; nor
  was the edifice appropriated to that entertainment less expressive of
  Roman greatness. Posterity admires, and will long admire, the awful
  remains of the amphitheatre of Titus, which so well deserved the epithet
  of Colossal. It was a building of an elliptic figure, five hundred and
  sixty-four feet in length, and four hundred and sixty-seven in breadth,
  founded on fourscore arches, and rising, with four successive orders of
  architecture, to the height of one hundred and forty feet. The outside of
  the edifice was encrusted with marble, and decorated with statues. The
  slopes of the vast concave, which formed the inside, were filled and
  surrounded with sixty or eighty rows of seats of marble likewise, covered
  with cushions, and capable of receiving with ease about fourscore thousand
  spectators. Sixty-four vomitories (for by that name the doors were very
  aptly distinguished) poured forth the immense multitude; and the
  entrances, passages, and staircases were contrived with such exquisite
  skill, that each person, whether of the senatorial, the equestrian, or the
  plebeian order, arrived at his destined place without trouble or
  confusion. Nothing was omitted, which, in any respect, could be
  subservient to the convenience and pleasure of the spectators. They were
  protected from the sun and rain by an ample canopy, occasionally drawn
  over their heads. The air was continally refreshed by the playing of
  fountains, and profusely impregnated by the grateful scent of aromatics.
  In the centre of the edifice, the arena, or stage, was strewed with the
  finest sand, and successively assumed the most different forms. At one
  moment it seemed to rise out of the earth, like the garden of the
  Hesperides, and was afterwards broken into the rocks and caverns of
  Thrace. The subterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhaustible supply of water;
  and what had just before appeared a level plain, might be suddenly
  converted into a wide lake, covered with armed vessels, and replenished
  with the monsters of the deep. In the decoration of these scenes, the
  Roman emperors displayed their wealth and liberality; and we read on
  various occasions that the whole furniture of the amphitheatre consisted
  either of silver, or of gold, or of amber. The poet who describes the
  games of Carinus, in the character of a shepherd, attracted to the capital
  by the fame of their magnificence, affirms that the nets designed as a
  defence against the wild beasts were of gold wire; that the porticos were
  gilded; and that the belt or circle which divided the several ranks of
  spectators from each other was studded with a precious mosaic of beautiful
  stones.
</p>
<p>
  In the midst of this glittering pageantry, the emperor Carinus, secure of
  his fortune, enjoyed the acclamations of the people, the flattery of his
  courtiers, and the songs of the poets, who, for want of a more essential
  merit, were reduced to celebrate the divine graces of his person. In the
  same hour, but at the distance of nine hundred miles from Rome, his
  brother expired; and a sudden revolution transferred into the hands of a
  stranger the sceptre of the house of Carus.
</p>
<p>
  The sons of Carus never saw each other after their father’s death. The
  arrangements which their new situation required were probably deferred
  till the return of the younger brother to Rome, where a triumph was
  decreed to the young emperors for the glorious success of the Persian war.
  It is uncertain whether they intended to divide between them the
  administration, or the provinces, of the empire; but it is very unlikely
  that their union would have proved of any long duration. The jealousy of
  power must have been inflamed by the opposition of characters. In the most
  corrupt of times, Carinus was unworthy to live: Numerian deserved to reign
  in a happier period. His affable manners and gentle virtues secured him,
  as soon as they became known, the regard and affections of the public. He
  possessed the elegant accomplishments of a poet and orator, which dignify
  as well as adorn the humblest and the most exalted station. His eloquence,
  however it was applauded by the senate, was formed not so much on the
  model of Cicero, as on that of the modern declaimers; but in an age very
  far from being destitute of poetical merit, he contended for the prize
  with the most celebrated of his contemporaries, and still remained the
  friend of his rivals; a circumstance which evinces either the goodness of
  his heart, or the superiority of his genius. But the talents of Numerian
  were rather of the contemplative than of the active kind. When his
  father’s elevation reluctantly forced him from the shade of retirement,
  neither his temper nor his pursuits had qualified him for the command of
  armies. His constitution was destroyed by the hardships of the Persian
  war; and he had contracted, from the heat of the climate, such a weakness
  in his eyes, as obliged him, in the course of a long retreat, to confine
  himself to the solitude and darkness of a tent or litter. The
  administration of all affairs, civil as well as military, was devolved on
  Arrius Aper, the Prætorian præfect, who to the power of his
  important office added the honor of being father-in-law to Numerian. The
  Imperial pavilion was strictly guarded by his most trusty adherents; and
  during many days, Aper delivered to the army the supposed mandates of
  their invisible sovereign.
</p>
<p>
  It was not till eight months after the death of Carus, that the Roman
  army, returning by slow marches from the banks of the Tigris, arrived on
  those of the Thracian Bosphorus. The legions halted at Chalcedon in Asia,
  while the court passed over to Heraclea, on the European side of the
  Propontis. But a report soon circulated through the camp, at first in
  secret whispers, and at length in loud clamors, of the emperor’s death,
  and of the presumption of his ambitious minister, who still exercised the
  sovereign power in the name of a prince who was no more. The impatience of
  the soldiers could not long support a state of suspense. With rude
  curiosity they broke into the Imperial tent, and discovered only the
  corpse of Numerian. The gradual decline of his health might have induced
  them to believe that his death was natural; but the concealment was
  interpreted as an evidence of guilt, and the measures which Aper had taken
  to secure his election became the immediate occasion of his ruin. Yet, even
  in the transport of their rage and grief, the troops observed a regular
  proceeding, which proves how firmly discipline had been reëstablished by
  the martial successors of Gallienus. A general assembly of the army was
  appointed to be held at Chalcedon, whither Aper was transported in chains,
  as a prisoner and a criminal. A vacant tribunal was erected in the midst
  of the camp, and the generals and tribunes formed a great military
  council. They soon announced to the multitude that their choice had fallen
  on Diocletian, commander of the domestics or body-guards, as the person
  the most capable of revenging and succeeding their beloved emperor. The
  future fortunes of the candidate depended on the chance or conduct of the
  present hour. Conscious that the station which he had filled exposed him
  to some suspicions, Diocletian ascended the tribunal, and raising his eyes
  towards the Sun, made a solemn profession of his own innocence, in the
  presence of that all-seeing Deity. Then, assuming the tone of a sovereign
  and a judge, he commanded that Aper should be brought in chains to the
  foot of the tribunal. “This man,” said he, “is the murderer of Numerian;”
  and without giving him time to enter on a dangerous justification, drew
  his sword, and buried it in the breast of the unfortunate præfect. A
  charge supported by such decisive proof was admitted without
  contradiction, and the legions, with repeated acclamations, acknowledged
  the justice and authority of the emperor Diocletian.
</p>
<p>
  Before we enter upon the memorable reign of that prince, it will be proper
  to punish and dismiss the unworthy brother of Numerian. Carinus possessed
  arms and treasures sufficient to support his legal title to the empire.
  But his personal vices overbalanced every advantage of birth and
  situation. The most faithful servants of the father despised the
  incapacity, and dreaded the cruel arrogance, of the son. The hearts of the
  people were engaged in favor of his rival, and even the senate was
  inclined to prefer a usurper to a tyrant. The arts of Diocletian inflamed
  the general discontent; and the winter was employed in secret intrigues,
  and open preparations for a civil war. In the spring, the forces of the
  East and of the West encountered each other in the plains of Margus, a
  small city of Mæsia, in the neighborhood of the Danube. The troops,
  so lately returned from the Persian war, had acquired their glory at the
  expense of health and numbers; nor were they in a condition to contend
  with the unexhausted strength of the legions of Europe. Their ranks were
  broken, and, for a moment, Diocletian despaired of the purple and of life.
  But the advantage which Carinus had obtained by the valor of his soldiers,
  he quickly lost by the infidelity of his officers. A tribune, whose wife
  he had seduced, seized the opportunity of revenge, and, by a single blow,
  extinguished civil discord in the blood of the adulterer.

Galerius, And Constantius.—General Reestablishment Of Order
And Tranquillity.—The Persian War, Victory, And Triumph.—The New Form Of Administration.—Abdication And Retirement Of
Diocletian And Maximian.<br>
</pre>
<p>
  As the reign of Diocletian was more illustrious than that of any of his
  predecessors, so was his birth more abject and obscure. The strong claims
  of merit and of violence had frequently superseded the ideal prerogatives
  of nobility; but a distinct line of separation was hitherto preserved
  between the free and the servile part of mankind. The parents of
  Diocletian had been slaves in the house of Anulinus, a Roman senator; nor
  was he himself distinguished by any other name than that which he derived
  from a small town in Dalmatia, from whence his mother deduced her origin.
  It is, however, probable that his father obtained the freedom of the
  family, and that he soon acquired an office of scribe, which was commonly
  exercised by persons of his condition. Favorable oracles, or rather the
  consciousness of superior merit, prompted his aspiring son to pursue the
  profession of arms and the hopes of fortune; and it would be extremely
  curious to observe the gradation of arts and accidents which enabled him
  in the end to fulfil those oracles, and to display that merit to the
  world. Diocletian was successively promoted to the government of Mæsia,
  the honors of the consulship, and the important command of the guards of
  the palace. He distinguished his abilities in the Persian war; and after
  the death of Numerian, the slave, by the confession and judgment of his
  rivals, was declared the most worthy of the Imperial throne. The malice of
  religious zeal, whilst it arraigns the savage fierceness of his colleague
  Maximian, has affected to cast suspicions on the personal courage of the
  emperor Diocletian. It would not be easy to persuade us of the cowardice
  of a soldier of fortune, who acquired and preserved the esteem of the
  legions as well as the favor of so many warlike princes. Yet even calumny
  is sagacious enough to discover and to attack the most vulnerable part.
  The valor of Diocletian was never found inadequate to his duty, or to the
  occasion; but he appears not to have possessed the daring and generous
  spirit of a hero, who courts danger and fame, disdains artifice, and
  boldly challenges the allegiance of his equals. His abilities were useful
  rather than splendid; a vigorous mind, improved by the experience and
  study of mankind; dexterity and application in business; a judicious
  mixture of liberality and economy, of mildness and rigor; profound
  dissimulation, under the disguise of military frankness; steadiness to
  pursue his ends; flexibility to vary his means; and, above all, the great
  art of submitting his own passions, as well as those of others, to the
  interest of his ambition, and of coloring his ambition with the most
  specious pretences of justice and public utility. Like Augustus,
  Diocletian may be considered as the founder of a new empire. Like the
  adopted son of Cæsar, he was distinguished as a statesman rather
  than as a warrior; nor did either of those princes employ force, whenever
  their purpose could be effected by policy.
</p>
<p>
  The victory of Diocletian was remarkable for its singular mildness. A
  people accustomed to applaud the clemency of the conqueror, if the usual
  punishments of death, exile, and confiscation, were inflicted with any
  degree of temper and equity, beheld, with the most pleasing astonishment,
  a civil war, the flames of which were extinguished in the field of battle.
  Diocletian received into his confidence Aristobulus, the principal
  minister of the house of Carus, respected the lives, the fortunes, and the
  dignity, of his adversaries, and even continued in their respective
  stations the greater number of the servants of Carinus. It is not
  improbable that motives of prudence might assist the humanity of the
  artful Dalmatian; of these servants, many had purchased his favor by
  secret treachery; in others, he esteemed their grateful fidelity to an
  unfortunate master. The discerning judgment of Aurelian, of Probus, and of
  Carus, had filled the several departments of the state and army with
  officers of approved merit, whose removal would have injured the public
  service, without promoting the interest of his successor. Such a conduct,
  however, displayed to the Roman world the fairest prospect of the new
  reign, and the emperor affected to confirm this favorable prepossession,
  by declaring, that, among all the virtues of his predecessors, he was the
  most ambitious of imitating the humane philosophy of Marcus Antoninus.
</p>
<p>
  The first considerable action of his reign seemed to evince his sincerity
  as well as his moderation. After the example of Marcus, he gave himself a
  colleague in the person of Maximian, on whom he bestowed at first the
  title of Cæsar, and afterwards that of Augustus. But the motives of
  his conduct, as well as the object of his choice, were of a very different
  nature from those of his admired predecessor. By investing a luxurious
  youth with the honors of the purple, Marcus had discharged a debt of
  private gratitude, at the expense, indeed, of the happiness of the state.
  By associating a friend and a fellow-soldier to the labors of government,
  Diocletian, in a time of public danger, provided for the defence both of
  the East and of the West. Maximian was born a peasant, and, like Aurelian,
  in the territory of Sirmium. Ignorant of letters, careless of laws, the
  rusticity of his appearance and manners still betrayed in the most
  elevated fortune the meanness of his extraction. War was the only art
  which he professed. In a long course of service he had distinguished
  himself on every frontier of the empire; and though his military talents
  were formed to obey rather than to command, though, perhaps, he never
  attained the skill of a consummate general, he was capable, by his valor,
  constancy, and experience, of executing the most arduous undertakings. Nor
  were the vices of Maximian less useful to his benefactor. Insensible to
  pity, and fearless of consequences, he was the ready instrument of every
  act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at once
  suggest and disclaim. As soon as a bloody sacrifice had been offered to
  prudence or to revenge, Diocletian, by his seasonable intercession, saved
  the remaining few whom he had never designed to punish, gently censured
  the severity of his stern colleague, and enjoyed the comparison of a
  golden and an iron age, which was universally applied to their opposite
  maxims of government. Notwithstanding the difference of their characters,
  the two emperors maintained, on the throne, that friendship which they had
  contracted in a private station. The haughty, turbulent spirit of
  Maximian, so fatal, afterwards, to himself and to the public peace, was
  accustomed to respect the genius of Diocletian, and confessed the
  ascendant of reason over brutal violence. From a motive either of pride or
  superstition, the two emperors assumed the titles, the one of Jovius, the
  other of Herculius. Whilst the motion of the world (such was the language
  of their venal orators) was maintained by the all-seeing wisdom of
  Jupiter, the invincible arm of Hercules purged the earth from monsters and
  tyrants.
</p>
<p>
  But even the omnipotence of Jovius and Herculius was insufficient to
  sustain the weight of the public administration. The prudence of
  Diocletian discovered that the empire, assailed on every side by the
  barbarians, required on every side the presence of a great army, and of an
  emperor. With this view, he resolved once more to divide his unwieldy
  power, and with the inferior title of Cæsars, * to confer on two
  generals of approved merit an unequal share of the sovereign authority.
  Galerius, surnamed Armentarius, from his original profession of a
  herdsman, and Constantius, who from his pale complexion had acquired the
  denomination of Chlorus, were the two persons invested with the second
  honors of the Imperial purple. In describing the country, extraction, and
  manners of Herculius, we have already delineated those of Galerius, who
  was often, and not improperly, styled the younger Maximian, though, in
  many instances both of virtue and ability, he appears to have possessed a
  manifest superiority over the elder. The birth of Constantius was less
  obscure than that of his colleagues. Eutropius, his father, was one of the
  most considerable nobles of Dardania, and his mother was the niece of the
  emperor Claudius. Although the youth of Constantius had been spent in
  arms, he was endowed with a mild and amiable disposition, and the popular
  voice had long since acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at last
  attained. To strengthen the bonds of political, by those of domestic,
  union, each of the emperors assumed the character of a father to one of
  the Cæsars, Diocletian to Galerius, and Maximian to Constantius; and
  each, obliging them to repudiate their former wives, bestowed his daughter
  in marriage or his adopted son. These four princes distributed among
  themselves the wide extent of the Roman empire. The defence of Gaul,
  Spain, and Britain, was intrusted to Constantius: Galerius was stationed
  on the banks of the Danube, as the safeguard of the Illyrian provinces.
  Italy and Africa were considered as the department of Maximian; and for
  his peculiar portion, Diocletian reserved Thrace, Egypt, and the rich
  countries of Asia. Every one was sovereign with his own jurisdiction; but
  their united authority extended over the whole monarchy, and each of them
  was prepared to assist his colleagues with his counsels or presence. The Cæsars,
  in their exalted rank, revered the majesty of the emperors, and the three
  younger princes invariably acknowledged, by their gratitude and obedience,
  the common parent of their fortunes. The suspicious jealousy of power
  found not any place among them; and the singular happiness of their union
  has been compared to a chorus of music, whose harmony was regulated and
  maintained by the skilful hand of the first artist.
</p>
<p>
  This important measure was not carried into execution till about six years
  after the association of Maximian, and that interval of time had not been
  destitute of memorable incidents. But we have preferred, for the sake of
  perspicuity, first to describe the more perfect form of Diocletian’s
  government, and afterwards to relate the actions of his reign, following
  rather the natural order of the events, than the dates of a very doubtful
  chronology.
</p>
<p>
  The first exploit of Maximian, though it is mentioned in a few words by
  our imperfect writers, deserves, from its singularity, to be recorded in a
  history of human manners. He suppressed the peasants of Gaul, who, under
  the appellation of Bagaudæ, had risen in a general insurrection;
  very similar to those which in the fourteenth century successively
  afflicted both France and England. It should seem that very many of those
  institutions, referred by an easy solution to the feudal system, are
  derived from the Celtic barbarians. When Cæsar subdued the Gauls,
  that great nation was already divided into three orders of men; the
  clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The first governed by
  superstition, the second by arms, but the third and last was not of any
  weight or account in their public councils. It was very natural for the
  plebeians, oppressed by debt, or apprehensive of injuries, to implore the
  protection of some powerful chief, who acquired over their persons and
  property the same absolute right as, among the Greeks and Romans, a master
  exercised over his slaves. The greatest part of the nation was gradually
  reduced into a state of servitude; compelled to perpetual labor on the
  estates of the Gallic nobles, and confined to the soil, either by the real
  weight of fetters, or by the no less cruel and forcible restraints of the
  laws. During the long series of troubles which agitated Gaul, from the
  reign of Gallienus to that of Diocletian, the condition of these servile
  peasants was peculiarly miserable; and they experienced at once the
  complicated tyranny of their masters, of the barbarians, of the soldiers,
  and of the officers of the revenue.
</p>
<p>
  Their patience was at last provoked into despair. On every side they rose
  in multitudes, armed with rustic weapons, and with irresistible fury. The
  ploughman became a foot soldier, the shepherd mounted on horseback, the
  deserted villages and open towns were abandoned to the flames, and the
  ravages of the peasants equalled those of the fiercest barbarians. They
  asserted the natural rights of men, but they asserted those rights with
  the most savage cruelty. The Gallic nobles, justly dreading their revenge,
  either took refuge in the fortified cities, or fled from the wild scene of
  anarchy. The peasants reigned without control; and two of their most
  daring leaders had the folly and rashness to assume the Imperial
  ornaments. Their power soon expired at the approach of the legions. The
  strength of union and discipline obtained an easy victory over a
  licentious and divided multitude. A severe retaliation was inflicted on
  the peasants who were found in arms; the affrighted remnant returned to
  their respective habitations, and their unsuccessful effort for freedom
  served only to confirm their slavery. So strong and uniform is the current
  of popular passions, that we might almost venture, from very scanty
  materials, to relate the particulars of this war; but we are not disposed
  to believe that the principal leaders, Ælianus and Amandus, were
  Christians, or to insinuate, that the rebellion, as it happened in the
  time of Luther, was occasioned by the abuse of those benevolent principles
  of Christianity, which inculcate the natural freedom of mankind.
</p>
<p>
  Maximian had no sooner recovered Gaul from the hands of the peasants, than
  he lost Britain by the usurpation of Carausius. Ever since the rash but
  successful enterprise of the Franks under the reign of Probus, their
  daring countrymen had constructed squadrons of light brigantines, in which
  they incessantly ravaged the provinces adjacent to the ocean. To repel
  their desultory incursions, it was found necessary to create a naval
  power; and the judicious measure was prosecuted with prudence and vigor.
  Gessoriacum, or Boulogne, in the straits of the British Channel, was
  chosen by the emperor for the station of the Roman fleet; and the command
  of it was intrusted to Carausius, a Menapian of the meanest origin, but
  who had long signalized his skill as a pilot, and his valor as a soldier.
  The integrity of the new admiral corresponded not with his abilities. When
  the German pirates sailed from their own harbors, he connived at their
  passage, but he diligently intercepted their return, and appropriated to
  his own use an ample share of the spoil which they had acquired. The
  wealth of Carausius was, on this occasion, very justly considered as an
  evidence of his guilt; and Maximian had already given orders for his
  death. But the crafty Menapian foresaw and prevented the severity of the
  emperor. By his liberality he had attached to his fortunes the fleet which
  he commanded, and secured the barbarians in his interest. From the port of
  Boulogne he sailed over to Britain, persuaded the legion, and the
  auxiliaries which guarded that island, to embrace his party, and boldly
  assuming, with the Imperial purple, the title of Augustus, defied the
  justice and the arms of his injured sovereign.
</p>
<p>
  When Britain was thus dismembered from the empire, its importance was
  sensibly felt, and its loss sincerely lamented. The Romans celebrated, and
  perhaps magnified, the extent of that noble island, provided on every side
  with convenient harbors; the temperature of the climate, and the fertility
  of the soil, alike adapted for the production of corn or of vines; the
  valuable minerals with which it abounded; its rich pastures covered with
  innumerable flocks, and its woods free from wild beasts or venomous
  serpents. Above all, they regretted the large amount of the revenue of
  Britain, whilst they confessed, that such a province well deserved to
  become the seat of an independent monarchy. During the space of seven
  years it was possessed by Carausius; and fortune continued propitious to a
  rebellion supported with courage and ability. The British emperor defended
  the frontiers of his dominions against the Caledonians of the North,
  invited, from the continent, a great number of skilful artists, and
  displayed, on a variety of coins that are still extant, his taste and
  opulence. Born on the confines of the Franks, he courted the friendship of
  that formidable people, by the flattering imitation of their dress and
  manners. The bravest of their youth he enlisted among his land or sea
  forces; and, in return for their useful alliance, he communicated to the
  barbarians the dangerous knowledge of military and naval arts. Carausius
  still preserved the possession of Boulogne and the adjacent country. His
  fleets rode triumphant in the channel, commanded the mouths of the Seine
  and of the Rhine, ravaged the coasts of the ocean, and diffused beyond the
  columns of Hercules the terror of his name. Under his command, Britain,
  destined in a future age to obtain the empire of the sea, already assumed
  its natural and respectable station of a maritime power.
</p>
<p>
  By seizing the fleet of Boulogne, Carausius had deprived his master of the
  means of pursuit and revenge. And when, after a vast expense of time and
  labor, a new armament was launched into the water, the Imperial troops,
  unaccustomed to that element, were easily baffled and defeated by the
  veteran sailors of the usurper. This disappointed effort was soon
  productive of a treaty of peace. Diocletian and his colleague, who justly
  dreaded the enterprising spirit of Carausius, resigned to him the
  sovereignty of Britain, and reluctantly admitted their perfidious servant
  to a participation of the Imperial honors. But the adoption of the two Cæsars
  restored new vigor to the Romans arms; and while the Rhine was guarded by
  the presence of Maximian, his brave associate Constantius assumed the
  conduct of the British war. His first enterprise was against the important
  place of Boulogne. A stupendous mole, raised across the entrance of the
  harbor, intercepted all hopes of relief. The town surrendered after an
  obstinate defence; and a considerable part of the naval strength of
  Carausius fell into the hands of the besiegers. During the three years
  which Constantius employed in preparing a fleet adequate to the conquest
  of Britain, he secured the coast of Gaul, invaded the country of the
  Franks, and deprived the usurper of the assistance of those powerful
  allies.
</p>
<p>
  Before the preparations were finished, Constantius received the
  intelligence of the tyrant’s death, and it was considered as a sure
  presage of the approaching victory. The servants of Carausius imitated the
  example of treason which he had given. He was murdered by his first
  minister, Allectus, and the assassin succeeded to his power and to his
  danger. But he possessed not equal abilities either to exercise the one or
  to repel the other. He beheld, with anxious terror, the opposite shores of
  the continent already filled with arms, with troops, and with vessels; for
  Constantius had very prudently divided his forces, that he might likewise
  divide the attention and resistance of the enemy. The attack was at length
  made by the principal squadron, which, under the command of the præfect
  Asclepiodatus, an officer of distinguished merit, had been assembled in
  the north of the Seine. So imperfect in those times was the art of
  navigation, that orators have celebrated the daring courage of the Romans,
  who ventured to set sail with a side-wind, and on a stormy day. The
  weather proved favorable to their enterprise. Under the cover of a thick
  fog, they escaped the fleet of Allectus, which had been stationed off the
  Isle of Wight to receive them, landed in safety on some part of the
  western coast, and convinced the Britons, that a superiority of naval
  strength will not always protect their country from a foreign invasion.
  Asclepiodatus had no sooner disembarked the imperial troops, then he set
  fire to his ships; and, as the expedition proved fortunate, his heroic
  conduct was universally admired. The usurper had posted himself near
  London, to expect the formidable attack of Constantius, who commanded in
  person the fleet of Boulogne; but the descent of a new enemy required his
  immediate presence in the West. He performed this long march in so
  precipitate a manner, that he encountered the whole force of the præfect
  with a small body of harassed and disheartened troops. The engagement was
  soon terminated by the total defeat and death of Allectus; a single
  battle, as it has often happened, decided the fate of this great island;
  and when Constantius landed on the shores of Kent, he found them covered
  with obedient subjects. Their acclamations were loud and unanimous; and
  the virtues of the conqueror may induce us to believe, that they sincerely
  rejoiced in a revolution, which, after a separation of ten years, restored
  Britain to the body of the Roman empire.

  Chapter XIII: Reign Of Diocletian And His Three Associates.—Part
  II.
</h2>
<p>
  Britain had none but domestic enemies to dread; and as long as the
  governors preserved their fidelity, and the troops their discipline, the
  incursions of the naked savages of Scotland or Ireland could never
  materially affect the safety of the province. The peace of the continent,
  and the defence of the principal rivers which bounded the empire, were
  objects of far greater difficulty and importance. The policy of
  Diocletian, which inspired the councils of his associates, provided for
  the public tranquility, by encouraging a spirit of dissension among the
  barbarians, and by strengthening the fortifications of the Roman limit. In
  the East he fixed a line of camps from Egypt to the Persian dominions, and
  for every camp, he instituted an adequate number of stationary troops,
  commanded by their respective officers, and supplied with every kind of
  arms, from the new arsenals which he had formed at Antioch, Emesa, and
  Damascus. Nor was the precaution of the emperor less watchful against the
  well-known valor of the barbarians of Europe. From the mouth of the Rhine
  to that of the Danube, the ancient camps, towns, and citidels, were
  diligently reëstablished, and, in the most exposed places, new ones were
  skilfully constructed: the strictest vigilance was introduced among the
  garrisons of the frontier, and every expedient was practised that could
  render the long chain of fortifications firm and impenetrable. A barrier
  so respectable was seldom violated, and the barbarians often turned
  against each other their disappointed rage. The Goths, the Vandals, the
  Gepidæ, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, wasted each other’s strength
  by destructive hostilities: and whosoever vanquished, they vanquished the
  enemies of Rome. The subjects of Diocletian enjoyed the bloody spectacle,
  and congratulated each other, that the mischiefs of civil war were now
  experienced only by the barbarians.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding the policy of Diocletian, it was impossible to maintain an
  equal and undisturbed tranquillity during a reign of twenty years, and
  along a frontier of many hundred miles. Sometimes the barbarians suspended
  their domestic animosities, and the relaxed vigilance of the garrisons
  sometimes gave a passage to their strength or dexterity. Whenever the
  provinces were invaded, Diocletian conducted himself with that calm
  dignity which he always affected or possessed; reserved his presence for
  such occasions as were worthy of his interposition, never exposed his
  person or reputation to any unnecessary danger, insured his success by
  every means that prudence could suggest, and displayed, with ostentation,
  the consequences of his victory. In wars of a more difficult nature, and
  more doubtful event, he employed the rough valor of Maximian; and that
  faithful soldier was content to ascribe his own victories to the wise
  counsels and auspicious influence of his benefactor. But after the
  adoption of the two Cæsars, the emperors themselves, retiring to a
  less laborious scene of action, devolved on their adopted sons the defence
  of the Danube and of the Rhine. The vigilant Galerius was never reduced to
  the necessity of vanquishing an army of barbarians on the Roman territory.
  The brave and active Constantius delivered Gaul from a very furious inroad
  of the Alemanni; and his victories of Langres and Vindonissa appear to
  have been actions of considerable danger and merit. As he traversed the
  open country with a feeble guard, he was encompassed on a sudden by the
  superior multitude of the enemy. He retreated with difficulty towards
  Langres; but, in the general consternation, the citizens refused to open
  their gates, and the wounded prince was drawn up the wall by the means of
  a rope. But, on the news of his distress, the Roman troops hastened from
  all sides to his relief, and before the evening he had satisfied his honor
  and revenge by the slaughter of six thousand Alemanni. From the monuments
  of those times, the obscure traces of several other victories over the
  barbarians of Sarmatia and Germany might possibly be collected; but the
  tedious search would not be rewarded either with amusement or with
  instruction.
</p>
<p>
  The conduct which the emperor Probus had adopted in the disposal of the
  vanquished was imitated by Diocletian and his associates. The captive
  barbarians, exchanging death for slavery, were distributed among the
  provincials, and assigned to those districts (in Gaul, the territories of
  Amiens, Beauvais, Cambray, Treves, Langres, and Troyes, are particularly
  specified ) which had been depopulated by the calamities of war. They were
  usefully employed as shepherds and husbandmen, but were denied the
  exercise of arms, except when it was found expedient to enroll them in the
  military service. Nor did the emperors refuse the property of lands, with
  a less servile tenure, to such of the barbarians as solicited the
  protection of Rome. They granted a settlement to several colonies of the
  Carpi, the Bastarnæ, and the Sarmatians; and, by a dangerous
  indulgence, permitted them in some measure to retain their national
  manners and independence. Among the provincials, it was a subject of
  flattering exultation, that the barbarian, so lately an object of terror,
  now cultivated their lands, drove their cattle to the neighboring fair,
  and contributed by his labor to the public plenty. They congratulated
  their masters on the powerful accession of subjects and soldiers; but they
  forgot to observe, that multitudes of secret enemies, insolent from favor,
  or desperate from oppression, were introduced into the heart of the
  empire.
</p>
<p>
  While the Cæsars exercised their valor on the banks of the Rhine and
  Danube, the presence of the emperors was required on the southern confines
  of the Roman world. From the Nile to Mount Atlas, Africa was in arms. A
  confederacy of five Moorish nations issued from their deserts to invade
  the peaceful provinces. Julian had assumed the purple at Carthage.
  Achilleus at Alexandria, and even the Blemmyes, renewed, or rather
  continued, their incursions into the Upper Egypt. Scarcely any
  circumstances have been preserved of the exploits of Maximian in the
  western parts of Africa; but it appears, by the event, that the progress
  of his arms was rapid and decisive, that he vanquished the fiercest
  barbarians of Mauritania, and that he removed them from the mountains,
  whose inaccessible strength had inspired their inhabitants with a lawless
  confidence, and habituated them to a life of rapine and violence.
  Diocletian, on his side, opened the campaign in Egypt by the siege of
  Alexandria, cut off the aqueducts which conveyed the waters of the Nile
  into every quarter of that immense city, and rendering his camp
  impregnable to the sallies of the besieged multitude, he pushed his
  reiterated attacks with caution and vigor. After a siege of eight months,
  Alexandria, wasted by the sword and by fire, implored the clemency of the
  conqueror, but it experienced the full extent of his severity. Many
  thousands of the citizens perished in a promiscuous slaughter, and there
  were few obnoxious persons in Egypt who escaped a sentence either of death
  or at least of exile. The fate of Busiris and of Coptos was still more
  melancholy than that of Alexandria: those proud cities, the former
  distinguished by its antiquity, the latter enriched by the passage of the
  Indian trade, were utterly destroyed by the arms and by the severe order
  of Diocletian. The character of the Egyptian nation, insensible to
  kindness, but extremely susceptible of fear, could alone justify this
  excessive rigor. The seditions of Alexandria had often affected the
  tranquillity and subsistence of Rome itself. Since the usurpation of
  Firmus, the province of Upper Egypt, incessantly relapsing into rebellion,
  had embraced the alliance of the savages of Æthiopia. The number of
  the Blemmyes, scattered between the Island of Meroe and the Red Sea, was
  very inconsiderable, their disposition was unwarlike, their weapons rude
  and inoffensive. Yet in the public disorders, these barbarians, whom
  antiquity, shocked with the deformity of their figure, had almost excluded
  from the human species, presumed to rank themselves among the enemies of
  Rome. Such had been the unworthy allies of the Egyptians; and while the
  attention of the state was engaged in more serious wars, their vexatious
  inroads might again harass the repose of the province. With a view of
  opposing to the Blemmyes a suitable adversary, Diocletian persuaded the
  Nobatæ, or people of Nubia, to remove from their ancient habitations
  in the deserts of Libya, and resigned to them an extensive but
  unprofitable territory above Syene and the cataracts of the Nile, with the
  stipulation, that they should ever respect and guard the frontier of the
  empire. The treaty long subsisted; and till the establishment of
  Christianity introduced stricter notions of religious worship, it was
  annually ratified by a solemn sacrifice in the isle of Elephantine, in
  which the Romans, as well as the barbarians, adored the same visible or
  invisible powers of the universe.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time that Diocletian chastised the past crimes of the
  Egyptians, he provided for their future safety and happiness by many wise
  regulations, which were confirmed and enforced under the succeeding
  reigns. One very remarkable edict which he published, instead of being
  condemned as the effect of jealous tyranny, deserves to be applauded as an
  act of prudence and humanity. He caused a diligent inquiry to be made “for
  all the ancient books which treated of the admirable art of making gold
  and silver, and without pity, committed them to the flames; apprehensive,
  as we are assumed, lest the opulence of the Egyptians should inspire them
  with confidence to rebel against the empire.” But if Diocletian had been
  convinced of the reality of that valuable art, far from extinguishing the
  memory, he would have converted the operation of it to the benefit of the
  public revenue. It is much more likely, that his good sense discovered to
  him the folly of such magnificent pretensions, and that he was desirous of
  preserving the reason and fortunes of his subjects from the mischievous
  pursuit. It may be remarked, that these ancient books, so liberally
  ascribed to Pythagoras, to Solomon, or to Hermes, were the pious frauds of
  more recent adepts. The Greeks were inattentive either to the use or to
  the abuse of chemistry. In that immense register, where Pliny has
  deposited the discoveries, the arts, and the errors of mankind, there is
  not the least mention of the transmutation of metals; and the persecution
  of Diocletian is the first authentic event in the history of alchemy. The
  conquest of Egypt by the Arabs diffused that vain science over the globe.
  Congenial to the avarice of the human heart, it was studied in China as in
  Europe, with equal eagerness, and with equal success. The darkness of the
  middle ages insured a favorable reception to every tale of wonder, and the
  revival of learning gave new vigor to hope, and suggested more specious
  arts of deception. Philosophy, with the aid of experience, has at length
  banished the study of alchemy; and the present age, however desirous of
  riches, is content to seek them by the humbler means of commerce and
  industry.
</p>
<p>
  The reduction of Egypt was immediately followed by the Persian war. It was
  reserved for the reign of Diocletian to vanquish that powerful nation, and
  to extort a confession from the successors of Artaxerxes, of the superior
  majesty of the Roman empire.
</p>
<p>
  We have observed, under the reign of Valerian, that Armenia was subdued by
  the perfidy and the arms of the Persians, and that, after the
  assassination of Chosroes, his son Tiridates, the infant heir of the
  monarchy, was saved by the fidelity of his friends, and educated under the
  protection of the emperors. Tiridates derived from his exile such
  advantages as he could never have obtained on the throne of Armenia; the
  early knowledge of adversity, of mankind, and of the Roman discipline. He
  signalized his youth by deeds of valor, and displayed a matchless
  dexterity, as well as strength, in every martial exercise, and even in the
  less honorable contests of the Olympian games. Those qualities were more
  nobly exerted in the defence of his benefactor Licinius. That officer, in
  the sedition which occasioned the death of Probus, was exposed to the most
  imminent danger, and the enraged soldiers were forcing their way into his
  tent, when they were checked by the single arm of the Armenian prince. The
  gratitude of Tiridates contributed soon afterwards to his restoration.
  Licinius was in every station the friend and companion of Galerius, and
  the merit of Galerius, long before he was raised to the dignity of Cæsar,
  had been known and esteemed by Diocletian. In the third year of that
  emperor’s reign Tiridates was invested with the kingdom of Armenia. The
  justice of the measure was not less evident than its expediency. It was
  time to rescue from the usurpation of the Persian monarch an important
  territory, which, since the reign of Nero, had been always granted under
  the protection of the empire to a younger branch of the house of Arsaces.
</p>
<p>
  When Tiridates appeared on the frontiers of Armenia, he was received with
  an unfeigned transport of joy and loyalty. During twenty-six years, the
  country had experienced the real and imaginary hardships of a foreign
  yoke. The Persian monarchs adorned their new conquest with magnificent
  buildings; but those monuments had been erected at the expense of the
  people, and were abhorred as badges of slavery. The apprehension of a
  revolt had inspired the most rigorous precautions: oppression had been
  aggravated by insult, and the consciousness of the public hatred had been
  productive of every measure that could render it still more implacable. We
  have already remarked the intolerant spirit of the Magian religion. The
  statues of the deified kings of Armenia, and the sacred images of the sun
  and moon, were broke in pieces by the zeal of the conqueror; and the
  perpetual fire of Ormuzd was kindled and preserved upon an altar erected
  on the summit of Mount Bagavan. It was natural, that a people exasperated
  by so many injuries, should arm with zeal in the cause of their
  independence, their religion, and their hereditary sovereign. The torrent
  bore down every obstacle, and the Persian garrisons retreated before its
  fury. The nobles of Armenia flew to the standard of Tiridates, all
  alleging their past merit, offering their future service, and soliciting
  from the new king those honors and rewards from which they had been
  excluded with disdain under the foreign government. The command of the
  army was bestowed on Artavasdes, whose father had saved the infancy of
  Tiridates, and whose family had been massacred for that generous action.
  The brother of Artavasdes obtained the government of a province. One of
  the first military dignities was conferred on the satrap Otas, a man of
  singular temperance and fortitude, who presented to the king his sister
  and a considerable treasure, both of which, in a sequestered fortress,
  Otas had preserved from violation. Among the Armenian nobles appeared an
  ally, whose fortunes are too remarkable to pass unnoticed. His name was
  Mamgo, his origin was Scythian, and the horde which acknowledge his
  authority had encamped a very few years before on the skirts of the
  Chinese empire, which at that time extended as far as the neighborhood of
  Sogdiana. Having incurred the displeasure of his master, Mamgo, with his
  followers, retired to the banks of the Oxus, and implored the protection
  of Sapor. The emperor of China claimed the fugitive, and alleged the
  rights of sovereignty. The Persian monarch pleaded the laws of
  hospitality, and with some difficulty avoided a war, by the promise that
  he would banish Mamgo to the uttermost parts of the West, a punishment, as
  he described it, not less dreadful than death itself. Armenia was chosen
  for the place of exile, and a large district was assigned to the Scythian
  horde, on which they might feed their flocks and herds, and remove their
  encampment from one place to another, according to the different seasons
  of the year. They were employed to repel the invasion of Tiridates; but
  their leader, after weighing the obligations and injuries which he had
  received from the Persian monarch, resolved to abandon his party. The
  Armenian prince, who was well acquainted with the merit as well as power
  of Mamgo, treated him with distinguished respect; and, by admitting him
  into his confidence, acquired a brave and faithful servant, who
  contributed very effectually to his restoration.
</p>
<p>
  For a while, fortune appeared to favor the enterprising valor of
  Tiridates. He not only expelled the enemies of his family and country from
  the whole extent of Armenia, but in the prosecution of his revenge he
  carried his arms, or at least his incursions, into the heart of Assyria.
  The historian, who has preserved the name of Tiridates from oblivion,
  celebrates, with a degree of national enthusiasm, his personal prowess:
  and, in the true spirit of eastern romance, describes the giants and the
  elephants that fell beneath his invincible arm. It is from other
  information that we discover the distracted state of the Persian monarchy,
  to which the king of Armenia was indebted for some part of his advantages.
  The throne was disputed by the ambition of contending brothers; and
  Hormuz, after exerting without success the strength of his own party, had
  recourse to the dangerous assistance of the barbarians who inhabited the
  banks of the Caspian Sea. The civil war was, however, soon terminated,
  either by a victor or by a reconciliation; and Narses, who was universally
  acknowledged as king of Persia, directed his whole force against the
  foreign enemy. The contest then became too unequal; nor was the valor of
  the hero able to withstand the power of the monarch. Tiridates, a second
  time expelled from the throne of Armenia, once more took refuge in the
  court of the emperors. * Narses soon reëstablished his authority over the
  revolted province; and loudly complaining of the protection afforded by
  the Romans to rebels and fugitives, aspired to the conquest of the East.
</p>
<p>
  Neither prudence nor honor could permit the emperors to forsake the cause
  of the Armenian king, and it was resolved to exert the force of the empire
  in the Persian war. Diocletian, with the calm dignity which he constantly
  assumed, fixed his own station in the city of Antioch, from whence he
  prepared and directed the military operations. The conduct of the legions
  was intrusted to the intrepid valor of Galerius, who, for that important
  purpose, was removed from the banks of the Danube to those of the
  Euphrates. The armies soon encountered each other in the plains of
  Mesopotamia, and two battles were fought with various and doubtful
  success; but the third engagement was of a more decisive nature; and the
  Roman army received a total overthrow, which is attributed to the rashness
  of Galerius, who, with an inconsiderable body of troops, attacked the
  innumerable host of the Persians. But the consideration of the country
  that was the scene of action, may suggest another reason for his defeat.
  The same ground on which Galerius was vanquished, had been rendered
  memorable by the death of Crassus, and the slaughter of ten legions. It
  was a plain of more than sixty miles, which extended from the hills of
  Carrhæ to the Euphrates; a smooth and barren surface of sandy
  desert, without a hillock, without a tree, and without a spring of fresh
  water. The steady infantry of the Romans, fainting with heat and thirst,
  could neither hope for victory if they preserved their ranks, nor break
  their ranks without exposing themselves to the most imminent danger. In
  this situation they were gradually encompassed by the superior numbers,
  harassed by the rapid evolutions, and destroyed by the arrows of the
  barbarian cavalry. The king of Armenia had signalized his valor in the
  battle, and acquired personal glory by the public misfortune. He was
  pursued as far as the Euphrates; his horse was wounded, and it appeared
  impossible for him to escape the victorious enemy. In this extremity
  Tiridates embraced the only refuge which appeared before him: he
  dismounted and plunged into the stream. His armor was heavy, the river
  very deep, and at those parts at least half a mile in breadth; yet such
  was his strength and dexterity, that he reached in safety the opposite
  bank. With regard to the Roman general, we are ignorant of the
  circumstances of his escape; but when he returned to Antioch, Diocletian
  received him, not with the tenderness of a friend and colleague, but with
  the indignation of an offended sovereign. The haughtiest of men, clothed
  in his purple, but humbled by the sense of his fault and misfortune, was
  obliged to follow the emperor’s chariot above a mile on foot, and to
  exhibit, before the whole court, the spectacle of his disgrace.
</p>
<p>
  As soon as Diocletian had indulged his private resentment, and asserted
  the majesty of supreme power, he yielded to the submissive entreaties of
  the Cæsar, and permitted him to retrieve his own honor, as well as
  that of the Roman arms. In the room of the unwarlike troops of Asia, which
  had most probably served in the first expedition, a second army was drawn
  from the veterans and new levies of the Illyrian frontier, and a
  considerable body of Gothic auxiliaries were taken into the Imperial pay.
  At the head of a chosen army of twenty-five thousand men, Galerius again
  passed the Euphrates; but, instead of exposing his legions in the open
  plains of Mesopotamia he advanced through the mountains of Armenia, where
  he found the inhabitants devoted to his cause, and the country as
  favorable to the operations of infantry as it was inconvenient for the
  motions of cavalry. Adversity had confirmed the Roman discipline, while
  the barbarians, elated by success, were become so negligent and remiss,
  that in the moment when they least expected it, they were surprised by the
  active conduct of Galerius, who, attended only by two horsemen, had with
  his own eyes secretly examined the state and position of their camp. A
  surprise, especially in the night time, was for the most part fatal to a
  Persian army. “Their horses were tied, and generally shackled, to prevent
  their running away; and if an alarm happened, a Persian had his housing to
  fix, his horse to bridle, and his corselet to put on, before he could
  mount.” On this occasion, the impetuous attack of Galerius spread disorder
  and dismay over the camp of the barbarians. A slight resistance was
  followed by a dreadful carnage, and, in the general confusion, the wounded
  monarch (for Narses commanded his armies in person) fled towards the
  deserts of Media. His sumptuous tents, and those of his satraps, afforded
  an immense booty to the conqueror; and an incident is mentioned, which
  proves the rustic but martial ignorance of the legions in the elegant
  superfluities of life. A bag of shining leather, filled with pearls, fell
  into the hands of a private soldier; he carefully preserved the bag, but
  he threw away its contents, judging that whatever was of no use could not
  possibly be of any value. The principal loss of Narses was of a much more
  affecting nature. Several of his wives, his sisters, and children, who had
  attended the army, were made captives in the defeat. But though the
  character of Galerius had in general very little affinity with that of
  Alexander, he imitated, after his victory, the amiable behavior of the
  Macedonian towards the family of Darius. The wives and children of Narses
  were protected from violence and rapine, conveyed to a place of safety,
  and treated with every mark of respect and tenderness, that was due from a
  generous enemy to their age, their sex, and their royal dignity.

  Chapter XIII: Reign Of Diocletian And His Three Associates.—Part
  III.
</h2>
<p>
  While the East anxiously expected the decision of this great contest, the
  emperor Diocletian, having assembled in Syria a strong army of
  observation, displayed from a distance the resources of the Roman power,
  and reserved himself for any future emergency of the war. On the
  intelligence of the victory he condescended to advance towards the
  frontier, with a view of moderating, by his presence and counsels, the
  pride of Galerius. The interview of the Roman princes at Nisibis was
  accompanied with every expression of respect on one side, and of esteem on
  the other. It was in that city that they soon afterwards gave audience to
  the ambassador of the Great King. The power, or at least the spirit, of
  Narses, had been broken by his last defeat; and he considered an immediate
  peace as the only means that could stop the progress of the Roman arms. He
  despatched Apharban, a servant who possessed his favor and confidence,
  with a commission to negotiate a treaty, or rather to receive whatever
  conditions the conqueror should impose. Apharban opened the conference by
  expressing his master’s gratitude for the generous treatment of his
  family, and by soliciting the liberty of those illustrious captives. He
  celebrated the valor of Galerius, without degrading the reputation of
  Narses, and thought it no dishonor to confess the superiority of the
  victorious Cæsar, over a monarch who had surpassed in glory all the
  princes of his race. Notwithstanding the justice of the Persian cause, he
  was empowered to submit the present differences to the decision of the
  emperors themselves; convinced as he was, that, in the midst of
  prosperity, they would not be unmindful of the vicissitudes of fortune.
  Apharban concluded his discourse in the style of eastern allegory, by
  observing that the Roman and Persian monarchies were the two eyes of the
  world, which would remain imperfect and mutilated if either of them should
  be put out.
</p>
<p>
  “It well becomes the Persians,” replied Galerius, with a transport of
  fury, which seemed to convulse his whole frame, “it well becomes the
  Persians to expatiate on the vicissitudes of fortune, and calmly to read
  us lectures on the virtues of moderation. Let them remember their own <i>moderation</i>
  towards the unhappy Valerian. They vanquished him by fraud, they treated
  him with indignity. They detained him till the last moment of his life in
  shameful captivity, and after his death they exposed his body to perpetual
  ignominy.” Softening, however, his tone, Galerius insinuated to the
  ambassador, that it had never been the practice of the Romans to trample
  on a prostrate enemy; and that, on this occasion, they should consult
  their own dignity rather than the Persian merit. He dismissed Apharban
  with a hope that Narses would soon be informed on what conditions he might
  obtain, from the clemency of the emperors, a lasting peace, and the
  restoration of his wives and children. In this conference we may discover
  the fierce passions of Galerius, as well as his deference to the superior
  wisdom and authority of Diocletian. The ambition of the former grasped at
  the conquest of the East, and had proposed to reduce Persia into the state
  of a province. The prudence of the latter, who adhered to the moderate
  policy of Augustus and the Antonines, embraced the favorable opportunity
  of terminating a successful war by an honorable and advantageous peace.
</p>
<p>
  In pursuance of their promise, the emperors soon afterwards appointed
  Sicorius Probus, one of their secretaries, to acquaint the Persian court
  with their final resolution. As the minister of peace, he was received
  with every mark of politeness and friendship; but, under the pretence of
  allowing him the necessary repose after so long a journey, the audience of
  Probus was deferred from day to day; and he attended the slow motions of
  the king, till at length he was admitted to his presence, near the River
  Asprudus in Media. The secret motive of Narses, in this delay, had been to
  collect such a military force as might enable him, though sincerely
  desirous of peace, to negotiate with the greater weight and dignity. Three
  persons only assisted at this important conference, the minister Apharban,
  the præfect of the guards, and an officer who had commanded on the
  Armenian frontier. The first condition proposed by the ambassador is not
  at present of a very intelligible nature; that the city of Nisibis might
  be established for the place of mutual exchange, or, as we should formerly
  have termed it, for the staple of trade, between the two empires. There is
  no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the Roman princes to improve
  their revenue by some restraints upon commerce; but as Nisibis was
  situated within their own dominions, and as they were masters both of the
  imports and exports, it should seem that such restraints were the objects
  of an internal law, rather than of a foreign treaty. To render them more
  effectual, some stipulations were probably required on the side of the
  king of Persia, which appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or
  to his dignity, that Narses could not be persuaded to subscribe them. As
  this was the only article to which he refused his consent, it was no
  longer insisted on; and the emperors either suffered the trade to flow in
  its natural channels, or contented themselves with such restrictions, as
  it depended on their own authority to establish.
</p>
<p>
  As soon as this difficulty was removed, a solemn peace was concluded and
  ratified between the two nations. The conditions of a treaty so glorious
  to the empire, and so necessary to Persia, may deserve a more
  peculiar attention, as the history of Rome presents very few transactions
  of a similar nature; most of her wars having either been terminated by
  absolute conquest, or waged against barbarians ignorant of the use of
  letters. I. The Aboras, or, as it is called by Xenophon, the Araxes, was
  fixed as the boundary between the two monarchies. That river, which rose
  near the Tigris, was increased, a few miles below Nisibis, by the little
  stream of the Mygdonius, passed under the walls of Singara, and fell into
  the Euphrates at Circesium, a frontier town, which, by the care of
  Diocletian, was very strongly fortified. Mesopotomia, the object of so
  many wars, was ceded to the empire; and the Persians, by this treaty,
  renounced all pretensions to that great province. II. They relinquished to
  the Romans five provinces beyond the Tigris. Their situation formed a very
  useful barrier, and their natural strength was soon improved by art and
  military skill. Four of these, to the north of the river, were districts
  of obscure fame and inconsiderable extent; Intiline, Zabdicene, Arzanene,
  and Moxoene; but on the east of the Tigris, the empire acquired the large
  and mountainous territory of Carduene, the ancient seat of the
  Carduchians, who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in the heart
  of the despotic monarchies of Asia. The ten thousand Greeks traversed
  their country, after a painful march, or rather engagement, of seven days;
  and it is confessed by their leader, in his incomparable relation of the
  retreat, that they suffered more from the arrows of the Carduchians, than
  from the power of the Great King. Their posterity, the Curds, with very
  little alteration either of name or manners, * acknowledged the nominal
  sovereignty of the Turkish sultan. III. It is almost needless to observe,
  that Tiridates, the faithful ally of Rome, was restored to the throne of
  his fathers, and that the rights of the Imperial supremacy were fully
  asserted and secured. The limits of Armenia were extended as far as the
  fortress of Sintha in Media, and this increase of dominion was not so much
  an act of liberality as of justice. Of the provinces already mentioned
  beyond the Tigris, the four first had been dismembered by the Parthians
  from the crown of Armenia; and when the Romans acquired the possession of
  them, they stipulated, at the expense of the usurpers, an ample
  compensation, which invested their ally with the extensive and fertile
  country of Atropatene. Its principal city, in the same situation perhaps
  as the modern Tauris, was frequently honored by the residence of
  Tiridates; and as it sometimes bore the name of Ecbatana, he imitated, in
  the buildings and fortifications, the splendid capital of the Medes. IV.
  The country of Iberia was barren, its inhabitants rude and savage. But
  they were accustomed to the use of arms, and they separated from the
  empire barbarians much fiercer and more formidable than themselves. The
  narrow defiles of Mount Caucasus were in their hands, and it was in their
  choice, either to admit or to exclude the wandering tribes of Sarmatia,
  whenever a rapacious spirit urged them to penetrate into the richer climes
  of the South. The nomination of the kings of Iberia, which was resigned by
  the Persian monarch to the emperors, contributed to the strength and
  security of the Roman power in Asia. The East enjoyed a profound
  tranquillity during forty years; and the treaty between the rival
  monarchies was strictly observed till the death of Tiridates; when a new
  generation, animated with different views and different passions,
  succeeded to the government of the world; and the grandson of Narses
  undertook a long and memorable war against the princes of the house of
  Constantine.
</p>
<p>
  The arduous work of rescuing the distressed empire from tyrants and
  barbarians had now been completely achieved by a succession of Illyrian
  peasants. As soon as Diocletian entered into the twentieth year of his
  reign, he celebrated that memorable æra, as well as the success of
  his arms, by the pomp of a Roman triumph. Maximian, the equal partner of
  his power, was his only companion in the glory of that day. The two Cæsars
  had fought and conquered, but the merit of their exploits was ascribed,
  according to the rigor of ancient maxims, to the auspicious influence of
  their fathers and emperors. The triumph of Diocletian and Maximian was
  less magnificent, perhaps, than those of Aurelian and Probus, but it was
  dignified by several circumstances of superior fame and good fortune.
  Africa and Britain, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Nile, furnished their
  respective trophies; but the most distinguished ornament was of a more
  singular nature, a Persian victory followed by an important conquest. The
  representations of rivers, mountains, and provinces, were carried before
  the Imperial car. The images of the captive wives, the sisters, and the
  children of the Great King, afforded a new and grateful spectacle to the
  vanity of the people. In the eyes of posterity, this triumph is
  remarkable, by a distinction of a less honorable kind. It was the last
  that Rome ever beheld. Soon after this period, the emperors ceased to
  vanquish, and Rome ceased to be the capital of the empire.
</p>
<p>
  The spot on which Rome was founded had been consecrated by ancient
  ceremonies and imaginary miracles. The presence of some god, or the memory
  of some hero, seemed to animate every part of the city, and the empire of
  the world had been promised to the Capitol. The native Romans felt and
  confessed the power of this agreeable illusion. It was derived from their
  ancestors, had grown up with their earliest habits of life, and was
  protected, in some measure, by the opinion of political utility. The form
  and the seat of government were intimately blended together, nor was it
  esteemed possible to transport the one without destroying the other. But
  the sovereignty of the capital was gradually annihilated in the extent of
  conquest; the provinces rose to the same level, and the vanquished nations
  acquired the name and privileges, without imbibing the partial affections,
  of Romans. During a long period, however, the remains of the ancient
  constitution, and the influence of custom, preserved the dignity of Rome.
  The emperors, though perhaps of African or Illyrian extraction, respected
  their adopted country, as the seat of their power, and the centre of their
  extensive dominions. The emergencies of war very frequently required their
  presence on the frontiers; but Diocletian and Maximian were the first
  Roman princes who fixed, in time of peace, their ordinary residence in the
  provinces; and their conduct, however it might be suggested by private
  motives, was justified by very specious considerations of policy. The
  court of the emperor of the West was, for the most part, established at
  Milan, whose situation, at the foot of the Alps, appeared far more
  convenient than that of Rome, for the important purpose of watching the
  motions of the barbarians of Germany. Milan soon assumed the splendor of
  an Imperial city. The houses are described as numerous and well built; the
  manners of the people as polished and liberal. A circus, a theatre, a
  mint, a palace, baths, which bore the name of their founder Maximian;
  porticos adorned with statues, and a double circumference of walls,
  contributed to the beauty of the new capital; nor did it seem oppressed
  even by the proximity of Rome. To rival the majesty of Rome was the
  ambition likewise of Diocletian, who employed his leisure, and the wealth
  of the East, in the embellishment of Nicomedia, a city placed on the verge
  of Europe and Asia, almost at an equal distance between the Danube and the
  Euphrates. By the taste of the monarch, and at the expense of the people,
  Nicomedia acquired, in the space of a few years, a degree of magnificence
  which might appear to have required the labor of ages, and became inferior
  only to Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, in extent of populousness. The life
  of Diocletian and Maximian was a life of action, and a considerable
  portion of it was spent in camps, or in the long and frequent marches; but
  whenever the public business allowed them any relaxation, they seemed to
  have retired with pleasure to their favorite residences of Nicomedia and
  Milan. Till Diocletian, in the twentieth year of his reign, celebrated his
  Roman triumph, it is extremely doubtful whether he ever visited the
  ancient capital of the empire. Even on that memorable occasion his stay
  did not exceed two months. Disgusted with the licentious familiarity of
  the people, he quitted Rome with precipitation thirteen days before it was
  expected that he should have appeared in the senate, invested with the
  ensigns of the consular dignity.
</p>
<p>
  The dislike expressed by Diocletian towards Rome and Roman freedom was
  not the effect of momentary caprice, but the result of the most artful
  policy. That crafty prince had framed a new system of Imperial government,
  which was afterwards completed by the family of Constantine; and as the
  image of the old constitution was religiously preserved in the senate, he
  resolved to deprive that order of its small remains of power and
  consideration. We may recollect, about eight years before the elevation
  of Diocletian, the transient greatness, and the ambitious hopes, of the
  Roman senate. As long as that enthusiasm prevailed, many of the nobles
  imprudently displayed their zeal in the cause of freedom; and after the
  successes of Probus had withdrawn their countenance from the republican
  party, the senators were unable to disguise their impotent resentment.
</p>
<p>
  As the sovereign of Italy, Maximian was intrusted with the care of
  extinguishing this troublesome, rather than dangerous spirit, and the
  task was perfectly suited to his cruel temper. The most illustrious
  members of the senate, whom Diocletian always affected to esteem, were
  involved, by his colleague, in the accusation of imaginary plots; and the
  possession of an elegant villa, or a well-cultivated estate, was
  interpreted as a convincing evidence of guilt. The camp of the
  Prætorians, which had so long oppressed, began to protect, the majesty of
  Rome; and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline of their
  power, they were naturally disposed to unite their strength with the
  authority of the senate. By the prudent measures of Diocletian, the
  numbers of the Prætorians were insensibly reduced, their privileges
  abolished, and their place supplied by two faithful legions of Illyricum,
  who, under the new titles of Jovians and Herculians, were appointed to
  perform the service of the Imperial guards. But the most fatal though
  secret wound, which the senate received from the hands of Diocletian and
  Maximian, was inflicted by the inevitable operation of their absence. As
  long as the emperors resided at Rome, that assembly might be oppressed,
  but it could scarcely be neglected. The successors of Augustus exercised
  the power of dictating whatever laws their wisdom or caprice might
  suggest; but those laws were ratified by the sanction of the senate. The
  model of ancient freedom was preserved in its deliberations and decrees;
  and wise princes, who respected the prejudices of the Roman people, were
  in some measure obliged to assume the language and behavior suitable to
  the general and first magistrate of the republic. In the armies and in
  the provinces, they displayed the dignity of monarchs; and when they
  fixed their residence at a distance from the capital, they forever laid
  aside the dissimulation which Augustus had recommended to his successors.
  In the exercise of the legislative as well as the executive power, the
  sovereign advised with his ministers, instead of consulting the great
  council of the nation. The name of the senate was mentioned with honor
  till the last period of the empire; the vanity of its members was still
  flattered with honorary distinctions; but the assembly which had so long
  been the source, and so long the instrument of power, was respectfully
  suffered to sink into oblivion. The senate of Rome, losing all connection
  with the Imperial court and the actual constitution, was left a venerable
  but useless monument of antiquity on the Capitoline hill.

  Chapter XIII: Reign Of Diocletian And His Three Associates.—Part
  IV.
</h2>
<p>
  When the Roman princes had lost sight of the senate and of their ancient
  capital, they easily forgot the origin and nature of their legal power.
  The civil offices of consul, of proconsul, of censor, and of tribune, by
  the union of which it had been formed, betrayed to the people its
  republican extraction. Those modest titles were laid aside; and if they
  still distinguished their high station by the appellation of Emperor, or
  Imperator, that word was understood in a new and more dignified sense, and
  no longer denoted the general of the Roman armies, but the sovereign of
  the Roman world. The name of Emperor, which was at first of a military
  nature, was associated with another of a more servile kind. The epithet of
  Dominus, or Lord, in its primitive signification, was expressive not of
  the authority of a prince over his subjects, or of a commander over his
  soldiers, but of the despotic power of a master over his domestic slaves.
  Viewing it in that odious light, it had been rejected with abhorrence by
  the first Cæsars. Their resistance insensibly became more feeble,
  and the name less odious; till at length the style of <i>our Lord
  and Emperor</i> was not only bestowed by flattery, but was
  regularly admitted into the laws and public monuments. Such lofty epithets
  were sufficient to elate and satisfy the most excessive vanity; and if the
  successors of Diocletian still declined the title of King, it seems to
  have been the effect not so much of their moderation as of their delicacy.
  Wherever the Latin tongue was in use, (and it was the language of
  government throughout the empire,) the Imperial title, as it was peculiar
  to themselves, conveyed a more respectable idea than the name of king,
  which they must have shared with a hundred barbarian chieftains; or which,
  at the best, they could derive only from Romulus, or from Tarquin. But the
  sentiments of the East were very different from those of the West. From
  the earliest period of history, the sovereigns of Asia had been celebrated
  in the Greek language by the title of Basileus, or King; and since it was
  considered as the first distinction among men, it was soon employed by the
  servile provincials of the East, in their humble addresses to the Roman
  throne. Even the attributes, or at least the titles, of the Divinity, were
  usurped by Diocletian and Maximian, who transmitted them to a succession
  of Christian emperors. Such extravagant compliments, however, soon lose
  their impiety by losing their meaning; and when the ear is once accustomed
  to the sound, they are heard with indifference, as vague though excessive
  professions of respect.
</p>
<p>
  From the time of Augustus to that of Diocletian, the Roman princes,
  conversing in a familiar manner among their fellow-citizens, were saluted
  only with the same respect that was usually paid to senators and
  magistrates. Their principal distinction was the Imperial or military robe
  of purple; whilst the senatorial garment was marked by a broad, and the
  equestrian by a narrow, band or stripe of the same honorable color. The
  pride, or rather the policy, of Diocletian engaged that artful prince to
  introduce the stately magnificence of the court of Persia. He ventured to
  assume the diadem, an ornament detested by the Romans as the odious ensign
  of royalty, and the use of which had been considered as the most desperate
  act of the madness of Caligula. It was no more than a broad white fillet
  set with pearls, which encircled the emperor’s head. The sumptuous robes
  of Diocletian and his successors were of silk and gold; and it is remarked
  with indignation that even their shoes were studded with the most
  precious gems. The access to their sacred person was every day rendered
  more difficult by the institution of new forms and ceremonies. The avenues
  of the palace were strictly guarded by the various <i>schools</i>,
  as they began to be called, of domestic officers. The interior apartments
  were intrusted to the jealous vigilance of the eunuchs, the increase of
  whose numbers and influence was the most infallible symptom of the
  progress of despotism. When a subject was at length admitted to the
  Imperial presence, he was obliged, whatever might be his rank, to fall
  prostrate on the ground, and to adore, according to the eastern fashion,
  the divinity of his lord and master. Diocletian was a man of sense, who,
  in the course of private as well as public life, had formed a just
  estimate both of himself and of mankind; nor is it easy to conceive that
  in substituting the manners of Persia to those of Rome he was seriously
  actuated by so mean a principle as that of vanity. He flattered himself
  that an ostentation of splendor and luxury would subdue the imagination of
  the multitude; that the monarch would be less exposed to the rude license
  of the people and the soldiers, as his person was secluded from the public
  view; and that habits of submission would insensibly be productive of
  sentiments of veneration. Like the modesty affected by Augustus, the state
  maintained by Diocletian was a theatrical representation; but it must be
  confessed, that of the two comedies, the former was of a much more liberal
  and manly character than the latter. It was the aim of the one to
  disguise, and the object of the other to display, the unbounded power
  which the emperors possessed over the Roman world.
</p>
<p>
  Ostentation was the first principle of the new system instituted by
  Diocletian. The second was division. He divided the empire, the provinces,
  and every branch of the civil as well as military administration. He
  multiplied the wheels of the machine of government, and rendered its
  operations less rapid, but more secure. Whatever advantages and whatever
  defects might attend these innovations, they must be ascribed in a very
  great degree to the first inventor; but as the new frame of policy was
  gradually improved and completed by succeeding princes, it will be more
  satisfactory to delay the consideration of it till the season of its full
  maturity and perfection. Reserving, therefore, for the reign of
  Constantine a more exact picture of the new empire, we shall content
  ourselves with describing the principal and decisive outline, as it was
  traced by the hand of Diocletian. He had associated three colleagues in
  the exercise of the supreme power; and as he was convinced that the
  abilities of a single man were inadequate to the public defence, he
  considered the joint administration of four princes not as a temporary
  expedient, but as a fundamental law of the constitution. It was his
  intention that the two elder princes should be distinguished by the use
  of the diadem, and the title of <i>Augusti</i>; that,
  as affection or esteem might direct their choice, they should regularly
  call to their assistance two subordinate colleagues; and that the <i>Cæsars</i>,
  rising in their turn to the first rank, should supply an uninterrupted
  succession of emperors. The empire was divided into four parts. The East
  and Italy were the most honorable, the Danube and the Rhine the most
  laborious stations. The former claimed the presence of the <i>Augusti</i>,
  the latter were intrusted to the administration of the <i>Cæsars</i>.
  The strength of the legions was in the hands of the four partners of
  sovereignty, and the despair of successively vanquishing four formidable
  rivals might intimidate the ambition of an aspiring general. In their
  civil government the emperors were supposed to exercise the undivided
  power of the monarch, and their edicts, inscribed with their joint names,
  were received in all the provinces, as promulgated by their mutual
  councils and authority. Notwithstanding these precautions, the political
  union of the Roman world was gradually dissolved, and a principle of
  division was introduced, which, in the course of a few years, occasioned
  the perpetual separation of the Eastern and Western Empires.
</p>
<p>
  The system of Diocletian was accompanied with another very material
  disadvantage, which cannot even at present be totally overlooked; a more
  expensive establishment, and consequently an increase of taxes, and the
  oppression of the people. Instead of a modest family of slaves and
  freedmen, such as had contented the simple greatness of Augustus and
  Trajan, three or four magnificent courts were established in the various
  parts of the empire, and as many Roman <i>kings</i>
  contended with each other and with the Persian monarch for the vain
  superiority of pomp and luxury. The number of ministers, of magistrates,
  of officers, and of servants, who filled the different departments of the
  state, was multiplied beyond the example of former times; and (if we may
  borrow the warm expression of a contemporary) “when the proportion of
  those who received exceeded the proportion of those who contributed, the
  provinces were oppressed by the weight of tributes.” From this period to
  the extinction of the empire, it would be easy to deduce an uninterrupted
  series of clamors and complaints. According to his religion and situation,
  each writer chooses either Diocletian, or Constantine, or Valens, or
  Theodosius, for the object of his invectives; but they unanimously agree
  in representing the burden of the public impositions, and particularly the
  land tax and capitation, as the intolerable and increasing grievance of
  their own times. From such a concurrence, an impartial historian, who is
  obliged to extract truth from satire, as well as from panegyric, will be
  inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they accuse, and to
  ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices, than to the
  uniform system of their administration. * The emperor Diocletian was
  indeed the author of that system; but during his reign, the growing evil
  was confined within the bounds of modesty and discretion, and he deserves
  the reproach of establishing pernicious precedents, rather than of
  exercising actual oppression. It may be added, that his revenues were
  managed with prudent economy; and that after all the current expenses were
  discharged, there still remained in the Imperial treasury an ample
  provision either for judicious liberality or for any emergency of the
  state.
</p>
<p>
  It was in the twenty first year of his reign that Diocletian executed his
  memorable resolution of abdicating the empire; an action more naturally to
  have been expected from the elder or the younger Antoninus, than from a
  prince who had never practised the lessons of philosophy either in the
  attainment or in the use of supreme power. Diocletian acquired the glory
  of giving to the world the first example of a resignation, which has not
  been very frequently imitated by succeeding monarchs. The parallel of
  Charles the Fifth, however, will naturally offer itself to our mind, not
  only since the eloquence of a modern historian has rendered that name so
  familiar to an English reader, but from the very striking resemblance
  between the characters of the two emperors, whose political abilities were
  superior to their military genius, and whose specious virtues were much
  less the effect of nature than of art. The abdication of Charles appears
  to have been hastened by the vicissitudes of fortune; and the
  disappointment of his favorite schemes urged him to relinquish a power
  which he found inadequate to his ambition. But the reign of Diocletian had
  flowed with a tide of uninterrupted success; nor was it till after he had
  vanquished all his enemies, and accomplished all his designs, that he
  seems to have entertained any serious thoughts of resigning the empire.
  Neither Charles nor Diocletian were arrived at a very advanced period of
  life; since the one was only fifty-five, and the other was no more than
  fifty-nine years of age; but the active life of those princes, their wars
  and journeys, the cares of royalty, and their application to business, had
  already impaired their constitution, and brought on the infirmities of a
  premature old age.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding the severity of a very cold and rainy winter, Diocletian
  left Italy soon after the ceremony of his triumph, and began his progress
  towards the East round the circuit of the Illyrian provinces. From the
  inclemency of the weather, and the fatigue of the journey, he soon
  contracted a slow illness; and though he made easy marches, and was
  generally carried in a close litter, his disorder, before he arrived at
  Nicomedia, about the end of the summer, was become very serious and
  alarming. During the whole winter he was confined to his palace: his
  danger inspired a general and unaffected concern; but the people could
  only judge of the various alterations of his health, from the joy or
  consternation which they discovered in the countenances and behavior of
  his attendants. The rumor of his death was for some time universally
  believed, and it was supposed to be concealed with a view to prevent the
  troubles that might have happened during the absence of the Cæsar
  Galerius. At length, however, on the first of March, Diocletian once more
  appeared in public, but so pale and emaciated, that he could scarcely have
  been recognized by those to whom his person was the most familiar. It was
  time to put an end to the painful struggle, which he had sustained during
  more than a year, between the care of his health and that of his dignity.
  The former required indulgence and relaxation, the latter compelled him to
  direct, from the bed of sickness, the administration of a great empire. He
  resolved to pass the remainder of his days in honorable repose, to place
  his glory beyond the reach of fortune, and to relinquish the theatre of
  the world to his younger and more active associates.
</p>
<p>
  The ceremony of his abdication was performed in a spacious plain, about
  three miles from Nicomedia. The emperor ascended a lofty throne, and in a
  speech, full of reason and dignity, declared his intention, both to the
  people and to the soldiers who were assembled on this extraordinary
  occasion. As soon as he had divested himself of his purple, he withdrew
  from the gazing multitude; and traversing the city in a covered chariot,
  proceeded, without delay, to the favorite retirement which he had chosen
  in his native country of Dalmatia. On the same day, which was the first of
  May, Maximian, as it had been previously concerted, made his resignation
  of the Imperial dignity at Milan. Even in the splendor of the Roman
  triumph, Diocletian had meditated his design of abdicating the government.
  As he wished to secure the obedience of Maximian, he exacted from him
  either a general assurance that he would submit his actions to the
  authority of his benefactor, or a particular promise that he would descend
  from the throne, whenever he should receive the advice and the example.
  This engagement, though it was confirmed by the solemnity of an oath
  before the altar of the Capitoline Jupiter, would have proved a feeble
  restraint on the fierce temper of Maximian, whose passion was the love of
  power, and who neither desired present tranquility nor future reputation.
  But he yielded, however reluctantly, to the ascendant which his wiser
  colleague had acquired over him, and retired, immediately after his
  abdication, to a villa in Lucania, where it was almost impossible that
  such an impatient spirit could find any lasting tranquility.
</p>
<p>
  Diocletian, who, from a servile origin, had raised himself to the throne,
  passed the nine last years of his life in a private condition. Reason had
  dictated, and content seems to have accompanied, his retreat, in which he
  enjoyed, for a long time, the respect of those princes to whom he had
  resigned the possession of the world. It is seldom that minds long
  exercised in business have formed any habits of conversing with
  themselves, and in the loss of power they principally regret the want of
  occupation. The amusements of letters and of devotion, which afford so
  many resources in solitude, were incapable of fixing the attention of
  Diocletian; but he had preserved, or at least he soon recovered, a taste
  for the most innocent as well as natural pleasures, and his leisure hours
  were sufficiently employed in building, planting, and gardening. His
  answer to Maximian is deservedly celebrated. He was solicited by that
  restless old man to reassume the reins of government, and the Imperial
  purple. He rejected the temptation with a smile of pity, calmly observing,
  that if he could show Maximian the cabbages which he had planted with his
  own hands at Salona, he should no longer be urged to relinquish the
  enjoyment of happiness for the pursuit of power. In his conversations with
  his friends, he frequently acknowledged, that of all arts, the most
  difficult was the art of reigning; and he expressed himself on that
  favorite topic with a degree of warmth which could be the result only of
  experience. “How often,” was he accustomed to say, “is it the interest of
  four or five ministers to combine together to deceive their sovereign!
  Secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity, the truth is concealed from
  his knowledge; he can see only with their eyes, he hears nothing but their
  misrepresentations. He confers the most important offices upon vice and
  weakness, and disgraces the most virtuous and deserving among his
  subjects. By such infamous arts,” added Diocletian, “the best and wisest
  princes are sold to the venal corruption of their courtiers.” A just
  estimate of greatness, and the assurance of immortal fame, improve our
  relish for the pleasures of retirement; but the Roman emperor had filled
  too important a character in the world, to enjoy without alloy the
  comforts and security of a private condition. It was impossible that he
  could remain ignorant of the troubles which afflicted the empire after his
  abdication. It was impossible that he could be indifferent to their
  consequences. Fear, sorrow, and discontent, sometimes pursued him into the
  solitude of Salona. His tenderness, or at least his pride, was deeply
  wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter; and the last moments
  of Diocletian were imbittered by some affronts, which Licinius and
  Constantine might have spared the father of so many emperors, and the
  first author of their own fortune. A report, though of a very doubtful
  nature, has reached our times, that he prudently withdrew himself from
  their power by a voluntary death.
</p>
<p>
  Before we dismiss the consideration of the life and character of
  Diocletian, we may, for a moment, direct our view to the place of his
  retirement. Salona, a principal city of his native province of Dalmatia,
  was near two hundred Roman miles (according to the measurement of the
  public highways) from Aquileia and the confines of Italy, and about two
  hundred and seventy from Sirmium, the usual residence of the emperors
  whenever they visited the Illyrian frontier. A miserable village still
  preserves the name of Salona; but so late as the sixteenth century, the
  remains of a theatre, and a confused prospect of broken arches and marble
  columns, continued to attest its ancient splendor. About six or seven
  miles from the city Diocletian constructed a magnificent palace, and we
  may infer, from the greatness of the work, how long he had meditated his
  design of abdicating the empire. The choice of a spot which united all
  that could contribute either to health or to luxury did not require the
  partiality of a native. “The soil was dry and fertile, the air is pure and
  wholesome, and, though extremely hot during the summer months, this country
  seldom feels those sultry and noxious winds to which the coasts of Istria
  and some parts of Italy are exposed. The views from the palace are no less
  beautiful than the soil and climate were inviting. Towards the west lies
  the fertile shore that stretches along the Adriatic, in which a number of
  small islands are scattered in such a manner as to give this part of the
  sea the appearance of a great lake. On the north side lies the bay, which
  led to the ancient city of Salona; and the country beyond it, appearing in
  sight, forms a proper contrast to that more extensive prospect of water,
  which the Adriatic presents both to the south and to the east. Towards the
  north, the view is terminated by high and irregular mountains, situated at
  a proper distance, and in many places covered with villages, woods, and
  vineyards.”
</p>
<p>
  Though Constantine, from a very obvious prejudice, affects to mention the
  palace of Diocletian with contempt, yet one of their successors, who could
  only see it in a neglected and mutilated state, celebrates its
  magnificence in terms of the highest admiration. It covered an extent of
  ground consisting of between nine and ten English acres. The form was
  quadrangular, flanked with sixteen towers. Two of the sides were near six
  hundred, and the other two near seven hundred feet in length. The whole
  was constructed of a beautiful freestone, extracted from the neighboring
  quarries of Trau, or Tragutium, and very little inferior to marble itself.
  Four streets, intersecting each other at right angles, divided the several
  parts of this great edifice, and the approach to the principal apartment
  was from a very stately entrance, which is still denominated the Golden
  Gate. The approach was terminated by a peristylium of granite columns, on
  one side of which we discover the square temple of Æsculapius, on
  the other the octagon temple of Jupiter. The latter of those deities
  Diocletian revered as the patron of his fortunes, the former as the
  protector of his health. By comparing the present remains with the
  precepts of Vitruvius, the several parts of the building, the baths,
  bedchamber, the atrium, the basilica, and the Cyzicene, Corinthian, and
  Egyptian halls have been described with some degree of precision, or at
  least of probability. Their forms were various, their proportions just;
  but they all were attended with two imperfections, very repugnant to our
  modern notions of taste and conveniency. These stately rooms had neither
  windows nor chimneys. They were lighted from the top, (for the building
  seems to have consisted of no more than one story,) and they received
  their heat by the help of pipes that were conveyed along the walls. The
  range of principal apartments was protected towards the south-west by a
  portico five hundred and seventeen feet long, which must have formed a
  very noble and delightful walk, when the beauties of painting and
  sculpture were added to those of the prospect.
</p>
<p>
  Had this magnificent edifice remained in a solitary country, it would have
  been exposed to the ravages of time; but it might, perhaps, have escaped
  the rapacious industry of man. The village of Aspalathus, and, long
  afterwards, the provincial town of Spalatro, have grown out of its ruins.
  The Golden Gate now opens into the market-place. St. John the Baptist has
  usurped the honors of Æsculapius; and the temple of Jupiter, under
  the protection of the Virgin, is converted into the cathedral church. For
  this account of Diocletian’s palace we are principally indebted to an
  ingenious artist of our own time and country, whom a very liberal
  curiosity carried into the heart of Dalmatia. But there is room to suspect
  that the elegance of his designs and engraving has somewhat flattered the
  objects which it was their purpose to represent. We are informed by a more
  recent and very judicious traveller, that the awful ruins of Spalatro are
  not less expressive of the decline of the art than of the greatness of the
  Roman empire in the time of Diocletian. If such was indeed the state of
  architecture, we must naturally believe that painting and sculpture had
  experienced a still more sensible decay. The practice of architecture is
  directed by a few general and even mechanical rules. But sculpture, and,
  above all, painting, propose to themselves the imitation not only of the
  forms of nature, but of the characters and passions of the human soul. In
  those sublime arts the dexterity of the hand is of little avail, unless
  it is animated by fancy, and guided by the most correct taste and
  observation.
</p>
<p>
  It is almost unnecessary to remark, that the civil distractions of the
  empire, the license of the soldiers, the inroads of the barbarians, and
  the progress of despotism, had proved very unfavorable to genius, and even
  to learning. The succession of Illyrian princes restored the empire
  without restoring the sciences. Their military education was not
  calculated to inspire them with the love of letters; and even the mind of
  Diocletian, however active and capacious in business, was totally
  uninformed by study or speculation. The professions of law and physic are
  of such common use and certain profit that they will always secure a
  sufficient number of practitioners endowed with a reasonable degree of
  abilities and knowledge; but it does not appear that the students in those
  two faculties appeal to any celebrated masters who have flourished within
  that period. The voice of poetry was silent. History was reduced to dry
  and confused abridgments, alike destitute of amusement and instruction. A
  languid and affected eloquence was still retained in the pay and service
  of the emperors, who encouraged not any arts except those which
  contributed to the gratification of their pride, or the defence of their
  power.
</p>
<p>
  The declining age of learning and of mankind is marked, however, by the
  rise and rapid progress of the new Platonists. The school of Alexandria
  silenced those of Athens; and the ancient sects enrolled themselves under
  the banners of the more fashionable teachers, who recommended their system
  by the novelty of their method, and the austerity of their manners.
  Several of these masters, Ammonius, Plotinus, Amelius, and Porphyry, were
  men of profound thought and intense application; but by mistaking the true
  object of philosophy, their labors contributed much less to improve than
  to corrupt the human understanding. The knowledge that is suited to our
  situation and powers, the whole compass of moral, natural, and
  mathematical science, was neglected by the new Platonists; whilst they
  exhausted their strength in the verbal disputes of metaphysics, attempted
  to explore the secrets of the invisible world, and studied to reconcile
  Aristotle with Plato, on subjects of which both these philosophers were as
  ignorant as the rest of mankind. Consuming their reason in these deep but
  unsubstantial meditations, their minds were exposed to illusions of fancy.
  They flattered themselves that they possessed the secret of disengaging
  the soul from its corporal prison; claimed a familiar intercourse with
  demons and spirits; and, by a very singular revolution, converted the
  study of philosophy into that of magic. The ancient sages had derided the
  popular superstition; after disguising its extravagance by the thin
  pretence of allegory, the disciples of Plotinus and Porphyry became its
  most zealous defenders. As they agreed with the Christians in a few
  mysterious points of faith, they attacked the remainder of their
  theological system with all the fury of civil war. The new Platonists
  would scarcely deserve a place in the history of science, but in that of
  the church the mention of them will very frequently occur.
