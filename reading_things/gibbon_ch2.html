<h1>HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h1>
<p>by Edward Gibbon</p>
<h2>Chapter II.</h2>
<div class="subtitle">Of The Union And Internal Prosperity Of The Roman Empire, In The Age Of The Antonines.</div>
<p id="p2.1.1|1.40">
   It is not alone by the rapidity, or extent of conquest, that we should
   estimate the greatness of Rome. The sovereign of the Russian deserts
   commands a larger portion of the globe. In the seventh summer after his
   passage of the Hellespont, Alexander erected the Macedonian trophies on
   the banks of the Hyphasis. Within less than a century, the irresistible
   Zingis, and the Mogul princes of his race, spread their cruel devastations
   and transient empire from the Sea of China, to the confines of Egypt and
   Germany. But the firm edifice of Roman power was raised and preserved by
   the wisdom of ages. The obedient provinces of Trajan and the Antonines
   were united by laws, and adorned by arts. They might occasionally suffer
   from the partial abuse of delegated authority; but the general principle
   of government was wise, simple, and beneficent. They enjoyed the religion
   of their ancestors, whilst in civil honors and advantages they were
   exalted, by just degrees, to an equality with their conquerors.
 </p>
<p id="p2.1.2|2.41">I. The policy of the emperors and the senate, as far as it concerned religion, was happily seconded by the reflections of the enlightened, and
   by the habits of the superstitious, part of their subjects. The various
   modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman world, were all considered
   by the people, as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and
   by the magistrate, as equally useful. And thus toleration produced not
   only mutual indulgence, but even religious concord.
 </p>
<p>
   The superstition of the people was not imbittered by any mixture of
   theological rancor; nor was it confined by the chains of any speculative
   system. The devout polytheist, though fondly attached to his national
   rites, admitted with implicit faith the different religions of the earth.
   Fear, gratitude, and curiosity, a dream or an omen, a singular disorder,
   or a distant journey, perpetually disposed him to multiply the articles of
   his belief, and to enlarge the list of his protectors. The thin texture of
   the Pagan mythology was interwoven with various but not discordant
   materials. As soon as it was allowed that sages and heroes, who had lived
   or who had died for the benefit of their country, were exalted to a state
   of power and immortality, it was universally confessed, that they
   deserved, if not the adoration, at least the reverence, of all mankind.
   The deities of a thousand groves and a thousand streams possessed, in
   peace, their local and respective influence; nor could the Romans who
   deprecated the wrath of the Tiber, deride the Egyptian who presented his
   offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile. The visible powers of
   nature, the planets, and the elements were the same throughout the
   universe. The invisible governors of the moral world were inevitably cast
   in a similar mould of fiction and allegory. Every virtue, and even vice,
   acquired its divine representative; every art and profession its patron,
   whose attributes, in the most distant ages and countries, were uniformly
   derived from the character of their peculiar votaries. A republic of gods
   of such opposite tempers and interests required, in every system, the
   moderating hand of a supreme magistrate, who, by the progress of knowledge
   and flattery, was gradually invested with the sublime perfections of an
   Eternal Parent, and an Omnipotent Monarch. Such was the mild spirit of
   antiquity, that the nations were less attentive to the difference, than to
   the resemblance, of their religious worship. The Greek, the Roman, and the
   Barbarian, as they met before their respective altars, easily persuaded
   themselves, that under various names, and with various ceremonies, they
   adored the same deities. The elegant mythology of Homer gave a beautiful,
   and almost a regular form, to the polytheism of the ancient world.
 </p>
<p>
   The philosophers of Greece deduced their morals from the nature of man,
   rather than from that of God. They meditated, however, on the Divine
   Nature, as a very curious and important speculation; and in the profound
   inquiry, they displayed the strength and weakness of the human
   understanding. Of the four most celebrated schools, the Stoics and the
   Platonists endeavored to reconcile the jaring interests of reason and
   piety. They have left us the most sublime proofs of the existence and
   perfections of the first cause; but, as it was impossible for them to
   conceive the creation of matter, the workman in the Stoic philosophy was
   not sufficiently distinguished from the work; whilst, on the contrary, the
   spiritual God of Plato and his disciples resembled an idea, rather than a
   substance. The opinions of the Academics and Epicureans were of a less
   religious cast; but whilst the modest science of the former induced them
   to doubt, the positive ignorance of the latter urged them to deny, the
   providence of a Supreme Ruler. The spirit of inquiry, prompted by
   emulation, and supported by freedom, had divided the public teachers of
   philosophy into a variety of contending sects; but the ingenious youth,
   who, from every part, resorted to Athens, and the other seats of learning
   in the Roman empire, were alike instructed in every school to reject and
   to despise the religion of the multitude. How, indeed, was it possible
   that a philosopher should accept, as divine truths, the idle tales of the
   poets, and the incoherent traditions of antiquity; or that he should
   adore, as gods, those imperfect beings whom he must have despised, as men?
   Against such unworthy adversaries, Cicero condescended to employ the arms
   of reason and eloquence; but the satire of Lucian was a much more
   adequate, as well as more efficacious, weapon. We may be well assured,
   that a writer, conversant with the world, would never have ventured to
   expose the gods of his country to public ridicule, had they not already
   been the objects of secret contempt among the polished and enlightened
   orders of society.
 </p>
<p>
   Notwithstanding the fashionable irreligion which prevailed in the age of
   the Antonines, both the interest of the priests and the credulity of the
   people were sufficiently respected. In their writings and conversation,
   the philosophers of antiquity asserted the independent dignity of reason;
   but they resigned their actions to the commands of law and of custom.
   Viewing, with a smile of pity and indulgence, the various errors of the
   vulgar, they diligently practised the ceremonies of their fathers,
   devoutly frequented the temples of the gods; and sometimes condescending
   to act a part on the theatre of superstition, they concealed the
   sentiments of an atheist under the sacerdotal robes. Reasoners of such a
   temper were scarcely inclined to wrangle about their respective modes of
   faith, or of worship. It was indifferent to them what shape the folly of
   the multitude might choose to assume; and they approached with the same
   inward contempt, and the same external reverence, the altars of the
   Libyan, the Olympian, or the Capitoline Jupiter.
 </p>
<p>
   It is not easy to conceive from what motives a spirit of persecution could
   introduce itself into the Roman councils. The magistrates could not be
   actuated by a blind, though honest bigotry, since the magistrates were
   themselves philosophers; and the schools of Athens had given laws to the
   senate. They could not be impelled by ambition or avarice, as the temporal
   and ecclesiastical powers were united in the same hands. The pontiffs were
   chosen among the most illustrious of the senators; and the office of
   Supreme Pontiff was constantly exercised by the emperors themselves. They
   knew and valued the advantages of religion, as it is connected with civil
   government. They encouraged the public festivals which humanize the
   manners of the people. They managed the arts of divination as a convenient
   instrument of policy; and they respected, as the firmest bond of society,
   the useful persuasion, that, either in this or in a future life, the crime
   of perjury is most assuredly punished by the avenging gods. But whilst
   they acknowledged the general advantages of religion, they were convinced
   that the various modes of worship contributed alike to the same salutary
   purposes; and that, in every country, the form of superstition, which had
   received the sanction of time and experience, was the best adapted to the
   climate, and to its inhabitants. Avarice and taste very frequently
   despoiled the vanquished nations of the elegant statues of their gods, and
   the rich ornaments of their temples; but, in the exercise of the religion
   which they derived from their ancestors, they uniformly experienced the
   indulgence, and even protection, of the Roman conquerors. The province of
   Gaul seems, and indeed only seems, an exception to this universal
   toleration. Under the specious pretext of abolishing human sacrifices, the
   emperors Tiberius and Claudius suppressed the dangerous power of the
   Druids: but the priests themselves, their gods and their altars, subsisted
   in peaceful obscurity till the final destruction of Paganism.
 </p>
<p>
   Rome, the capital of a great monarchy, was incessantly filled with
   subjects and strangers from every part of the world, who all introduced
   and enjoyed the favorite superstitions of their native country. Every city
   in the empire was justified in maintaining the purity of its ancient
   ceremonies; and the Roman senate, using the common privilege, sometimes
   interposed, to check this inundation of foreign rites. * The Egyptian
   superstition, of all the most contemptible and abject, was frequently
   prohibited: the temples of Serapis and Isis demolished, and their
   worshippers banished from Rome and Italy. But the zeal of fanaticism
   prevailed over the cold and feeble efforts of policy. The exiles returned,
   the proselytes multiplied, the temples were restored with increasing
   splendor, and Isis and Serapis at length assumed their place among the
   Roman Deities. Nor was this indulgence a departure from the old maxims of
   government. In the purest ages of the commonwealth, Cybele and Æsculapius
   had been invited by solemn embassies; and it was customary to tempt the
   protectors of besieged cities, by the promise of more distinguished honors
   than they possessed in their native country. Rome gradually became the
   common temple of her subjects; and the freedom of the city was bestowed on
   all the gods of mankind.
 </p>
<p>
   II. The narrow policy of preserving, without any foreign mixture, the pure
   blood of the ancient citizens, had checked the fortune, and hastened the
   ruin, of Athens and Sparta. The aspiring genius of Rome sacrificed vanity
   to ambition, and deemed it more prudent, as well as honorable, to adopt
   virtue and merit for her own wheresoever they were found, among slaves or
   strangers, enemies or barbarians. During the most flourishing æra of
   the Athenian commonwealth, the number of citizens gradually decreased from
   about thirty to twenty-one thousand. If, on the contrary, we study the
   growth of the Roman republic, we may discover, that, notwithstanding the
   incessant demands of wars and colonies, the citizens, who, in the first
   census of Servius Tullius, amounted to no more than eighty-three thousand,
   were multiplied, before the commencement of the social war, to the number
   of four hundred and sixty-three thousand men, able to bear arms in the
   service of their country. When the allies of Rome claimed an equal share
   of honors and privileges, the senate indeed preferred the chance of arms
   to an ignominious concession. The Samnites and the Lucanians paid the
   severe penalty of their rashness; but the rest of the Italian states, as
   they successively returned to their duty, were admitted into the bosom of
   the republic, and soon contributed to the ruin of public freedom. Under a
   democratical government, the citizens exercise the powers of sovereignty;
   and those powers will be first abused, and afterwards lost, if they are
   committed to an unwieldy multitude. But when the popular assemblies had
   been suppressed by the administration of the emperors, the conquerors were
   distinguished from the vanquished nations, only as the first and most
   honorable order of subjects; and their increase, however rapid, was no
   longer exposed to the same dangers. Yet the wisest princes, who adopted
   the maxims of Augustus, guarded with the strictest care the dignity of the
   Roman name, and diffused the freedom of the city with a prudent
   liberality.

   Chapter II: The Internal Prosperity In The Age Of The Antonines.—Part
   II.
 </h2>
<p id="p2.2.1">
   Till the privileges of Romans had been progressively extended to all the
   inhabitants of the empire, an important distinction was preserved between
   Italy and the provinces. The former was esteemed the centre of public
   unity, and the firm basis of the constitution. Italy claimed the birth, or
   at least the residence, of the emperors and the senate. The estates of the
   Italians were exempt from taxes, their persons from the arbitrary
   jurisdiction of governors. Their municipal corporations, formed after the
   perfect model of the capital, * were intrusted, under the immediate eye of
   the supreme power, with the execution of the laws. From the foot of the
   Alps to the extremity of Calabria, all the natives of Italy were born
   citizens of Rome. Their partial distinctions were obliterated, and they
   insensibly coalesced into one great nation, united by language, manners,
   and civil institutions, and equal to the weight of a powerful empire. The
   republic gloried in her generous policy, and was frequently rewarded by
   the merit and services of her adopted sons. Had she always confined the
   distinction of Romans to the ancient families within the walls of the
   city, that immortal name would have been deprived of some of its noblest
   ornaments. Virgil was a native of Mantua; Horace was inclined to doubt
   whether he should call himself an Apulian or a Lucanian; it was in Padua
   that an historian was found worthy to record the majestic series of Roman
   victories. The patriot family of the Catos emerged from Tusculum; and the
   little town of Arpinum claimed the double honor of producing Marius and
   Cicero, the former of whom deserved, after Romulus and Camillus, to be
   styled the Third Founder of Rome; and the latter, after saving his country
   from the designs of Catiline, enabled her to contend with Athens for the
   palm of eloquence.
 </p>
<p>
   The provinces of the empire (as they have been described in the preceding
   chapter) were destitute of any public force, or constitutional freedom. In
   Etruria, in Greece, and in Gaul, it was the first care of the senate to
   dissolve those dangerous confederacies, which taught mankind that, as the
   Roman arms prevailed by division, they might be resisted by union. Those
   princes, whom the ostentation of gratitude or generosity permitted for a
   while to hold a precarious sceptre, were dismissed from their thrones, as
   soon as they had performed their appointed task of fashioning to the yoke
   the vanquished nations. The free states and cities which had embraced the
   cause of Rome were rewarded with a nominal alliance, and insensibly sunk
   into real servitude. The public authority was everywhere exercised by the
   ministers of the senate and of the emperors, and that authority was
   absolute, and without control. But the same salutary maxims of government,
   which had secured the peace and obedience of Italy were extended to the
   most distant conquests. A nation of Romans was gradually formed in the
   provinces, by the double expedient of introducing colonies, and of
   admitting the most faithful and deserving of the provincials to the
   freedom of Rome.
 </p>
<p>
   “Wheresoever the Roman conquers, he inhabits,” is a very just observation
   of Seneca, confirmed by history and experience. The natives of Italy,
   allured by pleasure or by interest, hastened to enjoy the advantages of
   victory; and we may remark, that, about forty years after the reduction of
   Asia, eighty thousand Romans were massacred in one day, by the cruel
   orders of Mithridates. These voluntary exiles were engaged, for the most
   part, in the occupations of commerce, agriculture, and the farm of the
   revenue. But after the legions were rendered permanent by the emperors,
   the provinces were peopled by a race of soldiers; and the veterans,
   whether they received the reward of their service in land or in money,
   usually settled with their families in the country, where they had
   honorably spent their youth. Throughout the empire, but more particularly
   in the western parts, the most fertile districts, and the most convenient
   situations, were reserved for the establishment of colonies; some of which
   were of a civil, and others of a military nature. In their manners and
   internal policy, the colonies formed a perfect representation of their
   great parent; and they were soon endeared to the natives by the ties of
   friendship and alliance, they effectually diffused a reverence for the
   Roman name, and a desire, which was seldom disappointed, of sharing, in
   due time, its honors and advantages. The municipal cities insensibly
   equalled the rank and splendor of the colonies; and in the reign of
   Hadrian, it was disputed which was the preferable condition, of those
   societies which had issued from, or those which had been received into,
   the bosom of Rome. The right of Latium, as it was called, * conferred on
   the cities to which it had been granted, a more partial favor. The
   magistrates only, at the expiration of their office, assumed the quality
   of Roman citizens; but as those offices were annual, in a few years they
   circulated round the principal families. Those of the provincials who were
   permitted to bear arms in the legions; those who exercised any civil
   employment; all, in a word, who performed any public service, or displayed
   any personal talents, were rewarded with a present, whose value was
   continually diminished by the increasing liberality of the emperors. Yet
   even, in the age of the Antonines, when the freedom of the city had been
   bestowed on the greater number of their subjects, it was still accompanied
   with very solid advantages. The bulk of the people acquired, with that
   title, the benefit of the Roman laws, particularly in the interesting
   articles of marriage, testaments, and inheritances; and the road of
   fortune was open to those whose pretensions were seconded by favor or
   merit. The grandsons of the Gauls, who had besieged Julius Cæsar in
   Alesia, commanded legions, governed provinces, and were admitted into the
   senate of Rome. Their ambition, instead of disturbing the tranquillity of
   the state, was intimately connected with its safety and greatness.
 </p>
<p>
   So sensible were the Romans of the influence of language over national
   manners, that it was their most serious care to extend, with the progress
   of their arms, the use of the Latin tongue. The ancient dialects of Italy,
   the Sabine, the Etruscan, and the Venetian, sunk into oblivion; but in the
   provinces, the east was less docile than the west to the voice of its
   victorious preceptors. This obvious difference marked the two portions of
   the empire with a distinction of colors, which, though it was in some
   degree concealed during the meridian splendor of prosperity, became
   gradually more visible, as the shades of night descended upon the Roman
   world. The western countries were civilized by the same hands which
   subdued them. As soon as the barbarians were reconciled to obedience,
   their minds were open to any new impressions of knowledge and politeness.
   The language of Virgil and Cicero, though with some inevitable mixture of
   corruption, was so universally adopted in Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and
   Pannonia, that the faint traces of the Punic or Celtic idioms were
   preserved only in the mountains, or among the peasants. Education and
   study insensibly inspired the natives of those countries with the
   sentiments of Romans; and Italy gave fashions, as well as laws, to her
   Latin provincials. They solicited with more ardor, and obtained with more
   facility, the freedom and honors of the state; supported the national
   dignity in letters and in arms; and at length, in the person of Trajan,
   produced an emperor whom the Scipios would not have disowned for their
   countryman. The situation of the Greeks was very different from that of
   the barbarians. The former had been long since civilized and corrupted.
   They had too much taste to relinquish their language, and too much vanity
   to adopt any foreign institutions. Still preserving the prejudices, after
   they had lost the virtues, of their ancestors, they affected to despise
   the unpolished manners of the Roman conquerors, whilst they were compelled
   to respect their superior wisdom and power. Nor was the influence of the
   Grecian language and sentiments confined to the narrow limits of that once
   celebrated country. Their empire, by the progress of colonies and
   conquest, had been diffused from the Adriatic to the Euphrates and the
   Nile. Asia was covered with Greek cities, and the long reign of the
   Macedonian kings had introduced a silent revolution into Syria and Egypt.
   In their pompous courts, those princes united the elegance of Athens with
   the luxury of the East, and the example of the court was imitated, at an
   humble distance, by the higher ranks of their subjects. Such was the
   general division of the Roman empire into the Latin and Greek languages.
   To these we may add a third distinction for the body of the natives in
   Syria, and especially in Egypt, the use of their ancient dialects, by
   secluding them from the commerce of mankind, checked the improvements of
   those barbarians. The slothful effeminacy of the former exposed them to
   the contempt, the sullen ferociousness of the latter excited the aversion,
   of the conquerors. Those nations had submitted to the Roman power, but
   they seldom desired or deserved the freedom of the city: and it was
   remarked, that more than two hundred and thirty years elapsed after the
   ruin of the Ptolemies, before an Egyptian was admitted into the senate of
   Rome.
 </p>
<p>
   It is a just though trite observation, that victorious Rome was herself
   subdued by the arts of Greece. Those immortal writers who still command
   the admiration of modern Europe, soon became the favorite object of study
   and imitation in Italy and the western provinces. But the elegant
   amusements of the Romans were not suffered to interfere with their sound
   maxims of policy. Whilst they acknowledged the charms of the Greek, they
   asserted the dignity of the Latin tongue, and the exclusive use of the
   latter was inflexibly maintained in the administration of civil as well as
   military government. The two languages exercised at the same time their
   separate jurisdiction throughout the empire: the former, as the natural
   idiom of science; the latter, as the legal dialect of public transactions.
   Those who united letters with business were equally conversant with both;
   and it was almost impossible, in any province, to find a Roman subject, of
   a liberal education, who was at once a stranger to the Greek and to the
   Latin language.
 </p>
<p>
   It was by such institutions that the nations of the empire insensibly
   melted away into the Roman name and people. But there still remained, in
   the centre of every province and of every family, an unhappy condition of
   men who endured the weight, without sharing the benefits, of society. In
   the free states of antiquity, the domestic slaves were exposed to the
   wanton rigor of despotism. The perfect settlement of the Roman empire was
   preceded by ages of violence and rapine. The slaves consisted, for the
   most part, of barbarian captives, * taken in thousands by the chance of
   war, purchased at a vile price, accustomed to a life of independence, and
   impatient to break and to revenge their fetters. Against such internal
   enemies, whose desperate insurrections had more than once reduced the
   republic to the brink of destruction, the most severe regulations, and the
   most cruel treatment, seemed almost justified by the great law of
   self-preservation. But when the principal nations of Europe, Asia, and
   Africa were united under the laws of one sovereign, the source of foreign
   supplies flowed with much less abundance, and the Romans were reduced to
   the milder but more tedious method of propagation. * In their numerous
   families, and particularly in their country estates, they encouraged the
   marriage of their slaves. The sentiments of nature, the habits of
   education, and the possession of a dependent species of property,
   contributed to alleviate the hardships of servitude. The existence of a
   slave became an object of greater value, and though his happiness still
   depended on the temper and circumstances of the master, the humanity of
   the latter, instead of being restrained by fear, was encouraged by the
   sense of his own interest. The progress of manners was accelerated by the
   virtue or policy of the emperors; and by the edicts of Hadrian and the
   Antonines, the protection of the laws was extended to the most abject part
   of mankind. The jurisdiction of life and death over the slaves, a power
   long exercised and often abused, was taken out of private hands, and
   reserved to the magistrates alone. The subterraneous prisons were
   abolished; and, upon a just complaint of intolerable treatment, the
   injured slave obtained either his deliverance, or a less cruel master.
 </p>
<p>
   Hope, the best comfort of our imperfect condition, was not denied to the
   Roman slave; and if he had any opportunity of rendering himself either
   useful or agreeable, he might very naturally expect that the diligence and
   fidelity of a few years would be rewarded with the inestimable gift of
   freedom. The benevolence of the master was so frequently prompted by the
   meaner suggestions of vanity and avarice, that the laws found it more
   necessary to restrain than to encourage a profuse and undistinguishing
   liberality, which might degenerate into a very dangerous abuse. It was a
   maxim of ancient jurisprudence, that a slave had not any country of his
   own; he acquired with his liberty an admission into the political society
   of which his patron was a member. The consequences of this maxim would
   have prostituted the privileges of the Roman city to a mean and
   promiscuous multitude. Some seasonable exceptions were therefore provided;
   and the honorable distinction was confined to such slaves only as, for
   just causes, and with the approbation of the magistrate, should receive a
   solemn and legal manumission. Even these chosen freedmen obtained no more
   than the private rights of citizens, and were rigorously excluded from
   civil or military honors. Whatever might be the merit or fortune of their
   sons, <i>they</i> likewise were esteemed unworthy of a seat in the
   senate; nor were the traces of a servile origin allowed to be completely
   obliterated till the third or fourth generation. Without destroying the
   distinction of ranks, a distant prospect of freedom and honors was
   presented, even to those whom pride and prejudice almost disdained to
   number among the human species.
 </p>
<p>
   It was once proposed to discriminate the slaves by a peculiar habit; but
   it was justly apprehended that there might be some danger in acquainting
   them with their own numbers. Without interpreting, in their utmost
   strictness, the liberal appellations of legions and myriads, we may
   venture to pronounce, that the proportion of slaves, who were valued as
   property, was more considerable than that of servants, who can be computed
   only as an expense. The youths of a promising genius were instructed in
   the arts and sciences, and their price was ascertained by the degree of
   their skill and talents. Almost every profession, either liberal or
   mechanical, might be found in the household of an opulent senator. The
   ministers of pomp and sensuality were multiplied beyond the conception of
   modern luxury. It was more for the interest of the merchant or
   manufacturer to purchase, than to hire his workmen; and in the country,
   slaves were employed as the cheapest and most laborious instruments of
   agriculture. To confirm the general observation, and to display the
   multitude of slaves, we might allege a variety of particular instances. It
   was discovered, on a very melancholy occasion, that four hundred slaves
   were maintained in a single palace of Rome. The same number of four
   hundred belonged to an estate which an African widow, of a very private
   condition, resigned to her son, whilst she reserved for herself a much
   larger share of her property. A freedman, under the name of Augustus,
   though his fortune had suffered great losses in the civil wars, left
   behind him three thousand six hundred yoke of oxen, two hundred and fifty
   thousand head of smaller cattle, and what was almost included in the
   description of cattle, four thousand one hundred and sixteen slaves.
 </p>
<p>
   The number of subjects who acknowledged the laws of Rome, of citizens, of
   provincials, and of slaves, cannot now be fixed with such a degree of
   accuracy, as the importance of the object would deserve. We are informed,
   that when the Emperor Claudius exercised the office of censor, he took an
   account of six millions nine hundred and forty-five thousand Roman
   citizens, who, with the proportion of women and children, must have
   amounted to about twenty millions of souls. The multitude of subjects of
   an inferior rank was uncertain and fluctuating. But, after weighing with
   attention every circumstance which could influence the balance, it seems
   probable that there existed, in the time of Claudius, about twice as many
   provincials as there were citizens, of either sex, and of every age; and
   that the slaves were at least equal in number to the free inhabitants of
   the Roman world. * The total amount of this imperfect calculation would
   rise to about one hundred and twenty millions of persons; a degree of
   population which possibly exceeds that of modern Europe, and forms the
   most numerous society that has ever been united under the same system of
   government.
 </p>
<p id="p2.3.1">
   Domestic peace and union were the natural consequences of the moderate and
   comprehensive policy embraced by the Romans. If we turn our eyes towards
   the monarchies of Asia, we shall behold despotism in the centre, and
   weakness in the extremities; the collection of the revenue, or the
   administration of justice, enforced by the presence of an army; hostile
   barbarians established in the heart of the country, hereditary satraps
   usurping the dominion of the provinces, and subjects inclined to
   rebellion, though incapable of freedom. But the obedience of the Roman
   world was uniform, voluntary, and permanent. The vanquished nations,
   blended into one great people, resigned the hope, nay, even the wish, of
   resuming their independence, and scarcely considered their own existence
   as distinct from the existence of Rome. The established authority of the
   emperors pervaded without an effort the wide extent of their dominions,
   and was exercised with the same facility on the banks of the Thames, or of
   the Nile, as on those of the Tyber. The legions were destined to serve
   against the public enemy, and the civil magistrate seldom required the aid
   of a military force. In this state of general security, the leisure, as
   well as opulence, both of the prince and people, were devoted to improve
   and to adorn the Roman empire.

   Among the innumerable monuments of architecture constructed by the Romans,
   how many have escaped the notice of history, how few have resisted the
   ravages of time and barbarism! And yet, even the majestic ruins that are
   still scattered over Italy and the provinces, would be sufficient to prove
   that those countries were once the seat of a polite and powerful empire.
   Their greatness alone, or their beauty, might deserve our attention: but
   they are rendered more interesting, by two important circumstances, which
   connect the agreeable history of the arts with the more useful history of
   human manners. Many of those works were erected at private expense, and
   almost all were intended for public benefit.
 </p>
<p>
   It is natural to suppose that the greatest number, as well as the most
   considerable of the Roman edifices, were raised by the emperors, who
   possessed so unbounded a command both of men and money. Augustus was
   accustomed to boast that he had found his capital of brick, and that he
   had left it of marble. The strict economy of Vespasian was the source of
   his magnificence. The works of Trajan bear the stamp of his genius. The
   public monuments with which Hadrian adorned every province of the empire,
   were executed not only by his orders, but under his immediate inspection.
   He was himself an artist; and he loved the arts, as they conduced to the
   glory of the monarch. They were encouraged by the Antonines, as they
   contributed to the happiness of the people. But if the emperors were the
   first, they were not the only architects of their dominions. Their example
   was universally imitated by their principal subjects, who were not afraid
   of declaring to the world that they had spirit to conceive, and wealth to
   accomplish, the noblest undertakings. Scarcely had the proud structure of
   the Coliseum been dedicated at Rome, before the edifices, of a smaller
   scale indeed, but of the same design and materials, were erected for the
   use, and at the expense, of the cities of Capua and Verona. The
   inscription of the stupendous bridge of Alcantara attests that it was
   thrown over the Tagus by the contribution of a few Lusitanian communities.
   When Pliny was intrusted with the government of Bithynia and Pontus,
   provinces by no means the richest or most considerable of the empire, he
   found the cities within his jurisdiction striving with each other in every
   useful and ornamental work, that might deserve the curiosity of strangers,
   or the gratitude of their citizens. It was the duty of the proconsul to
   supply their deficiencies, to direct their taste, and sometimes to
   moderate their emulation. The opulent senators of Rome and the provinces
   esteemed it an honor, and almost an obligation, to adorn the splendor of
   their age and country; and the influence of fashion very frequently
   supplied the want of taste or generosity. Among a crowd of these private
   benefactors, we may select Herodes Atticus, an Athenian citizen, who lived
   in the age of the Antonines. Whatever might be the motive of his conduct,
   his magnificence would have been worthy of the greatest kings.
 </p>
<p>
   The family of Herod, at least after it had been favored by fortune, was
   lineally descended from Cimon and Miltiades, Theseus and Cecrops, Æacus
   and Jupiter. But the posterity of so many gods and heroes was fallen into
   the most abject state. His grandfather had suffered by the hands of
   justice, and Julius Atticus, his father, must have ended his life in
   poverty and contempt, had he not discovered an immense treasure buried
   under an old house, the last remains of his patrimony. According to the
   rigor of the law, the emperor might have asserted his claim, and the
   prudent Atticus prevented, by a frank confession, the officiousness of
   informers. But the equitable Nerva, who then filled the throne, refused to
   accept any part of it, and commanded him to use, without scruple, the
   present of fortune. The cautious Athenian still insisted, that the
   treasure was too considerable for a subject, and that he knew not how to
   <i>use it</i>. <i>Abuse it then</i>, replied the monarch, with a
   good-natured peevishness; for it is your own. Many will be of opinion,
   that Atticus literally obeyed the emperor’s last instructions; since he
   expended the greatest part of his fortune, which was much increased by an
   advantageous marriage, in the service of the public. He had obtained for
   his son Herod the prefecture of the free cities of Asia; and the young
   magistrate, observing that the town of Troas was indifferently supplied
   with water, obtained from the munificence of Hadrian three hundred myriads
   of drachms, (about a hundred thousand pounds,) for the construction of a
   new aqueduct. But in the execution of the work, the charge amounted to
   more than double the estimate, and the officers of the revenue began to
   murmur, till the generous Atticus silenced their complaints, by requesting
   that he might be permitted to take upon himself the whole additional
   expense.
 </p>
<p>
   The ablest preceptors of Greece and Asia had been invited by liberal
   rewards to direct the education of young Herod. Their pupil soon became a
   celebrated orator, according to the useless rhetoric of that age, which,
   confining itself to the schools, disdained to visit either the Forum or
   the Senate. He was honored with the consulship at Rome: but the greatest
   part of his life was spent in a philosophic retirement at Athens, and his
   adjacent villas; perpetually surrounded by sophists, who acknowledged,
   without reluctance, the superiority of a rich and generous rival. The
   monuments of his genius have perished; some considerable ruins still
   preserve the fame of his taste and munificence: modern travellers have
   measured the remains of the stadium which he constructed at Athens. It was
   six hundred feet in length, built entirely of white marble, capable of
   admitting the whole body of the people, and finished in four years, whilst
   Herod was president of the Athenian games. To the memory of his wife
   Regilla he dedicated a theatre, scarcely to be paralleled in the empire:
   no wood except cedar, very curiously carved, was employed in any part of
   the building. The Odeum, * designed by Pericles for musical performances,
   and the rehearsal of new tragedies, had been a trophy of the victory of
   the arts over barbaric greatness; as the timbers employed in the
   construction consisted chiefly of the masts of the Persian vessels.
   Notwithstanding the repairs bestowed on that ancient edifice by a king of
   Cappadocia, it was again fallen to decay. Herod restored its ancient
   beauty and magnificence. Nor was the liberality of that illustrious
   citizen confined to the walls of Athens. The most splendid ornaments
   bestowed on the temple of Neptune in the Isthmus, a theatre at Corinth, a
   stadium at Delphi, a bath at Thermopylæ, and an aqueduct at Canusium
   in Italy, were insufficient to exhaust his treasures. The people of
   Epirus, Thessaly, Euboea, Boeotia, and Peloponnesus, experienced his
   favors; and many inscriptions of the cities of Greece and Asia gratefully
   style Herodes Atticus their patron and benefactor.
 </p>
<p>
   In the commonwealths of Athens and Rome, the modest simplicity of private
   houses announced the equal condition of freedom; whilst the sovereignty of
   the people was represented in the majestic edifices designed to the public
   use; nor was this republican spirit totally extinguished by the
   introduction of wealth and monarchy. It was in works of national honor and
   benefit, that the most virtuous of the emperors affected to display their
   magnificence. The golden palace of Nero excited a just indignation, but
   the vast extent of ground which had been usurped by his selfish luxury was
   more nobly filled under the succeeding reigns by the Coliseum, the baths
   of Titus, the Claudian portico, and the temples dedicated to the goddess
   of Peace, and to the genius of Rome. These monuments of architecture, the
   property of the Roman people, were adorned with the most beautiful
   productions of Grecian painting and sculpture; and in the temple of Peace,
   a very curious library was open to the curiosity of the learned. * At a
   small distance from thence was situated the Forum of Trajan. It was
   surrounded by a lofty portico, in the form of a quadrangle, into which
   four triumphal arches opened a noble and spacious entrance: in the centre
   arose a column of marble, whose height, of one hundred and ten feet,
   denoted the elevation of the hill that had been cut away. This column,
   which still subsists in its ancient beauty, exhibited an exact
   representation of the Dacian victories of its founder. The veteran soldier
   contemplated the story of his own campaigns, and by an easy illusion of
   national vanity, the peaceful citizen associated himself to the honors of
   the triumph. All the other quarters of the capital, and all the provinces
   of the empire, were embellished by the same liberal spirit of public
   magnificence, and were filled with amphitheatres, theatres, temples,
   porticoes, triumphal arches, baths and aqueducts, all variously conducive
   to the health, the devotion, and the pleasures of the meanest citizen. The
   last mentioned of those edifices deserve our peculiar attention. The
   boldness of the enterprise, the solidity of the execution, and the uses to
   which they were subservient, rank the aqueducts among the noblest
   monuments of Roman genius and power. The aqueducts of the capital claim a
   just preeminence; but the curious traveller, who, without the light of
   history, should examine those of Spoleto, of Metz, or of Segovia, would
   very naturally conclude that those provincial towns had formerly been the
   residence of some potent monarch. The solitudes of Asia and Africa were
   once covered with flourishing cities, whose populousness, and even whose
   existence, was derived from such artificial supplies of a perennial stream
   of fresh water.
 </p>
<p>
   We have computed the inhabitants, and contemplated the public works, of
   the Roman empire. The observation of the number and greatness of its
   cities will serve to confirm the former, and to multiply the latter. It
   may not be unpleasing to collect a few scattered instances relative to
   that subject without forgetting, however, that from the vanity of nations
   and the poverty of language, the vague appellation of city has been
   indifferently bestowed on Rome and upon Laurentum.
 </p>
<p>
   I. <i>Ancient</i> Italy is said to have contained eleven hundred and
   ninety-seven cities; and for whatsoever æra of antiquity the
   expression might be intended, there is not any reason to believe the
   country less populous in the age of the Antonines, than in that of
   Romulus. The petty states of Latium were contained within the metropolis
   of the empire, by whose superior influence they had been attracted. *
   Those parts of Italy which have so long languished under the lazy tyranny
   of priests and viceroys, had been afflicted only by the more tolerable
   calamities of war; and the first symptoms of decay which they experienced,
   were amply compensated by the rapid improvements of the Cisalpine Gaul.
   The splendor of Verona may be traced in its remains: yet Verona was less
   celebrated than Aquileia or Padua, Milan or Ravenna. II. The spirit of
   improvement had passed the Alps, and been felt even in the woods of
   Britain, which were gradually cleared away to open a free space for
   convenient and elegant habitations. York was the seat of government;
   London was already enriched by commerce; and Bath was celebrated for the
   salutary effects of its medicinal waters. Gaul could boast of her twelve
   hundred cities; and though, in the northern parts, many of them, without
   excepting Paris itself, were little more than the rude and imperfect
   townships of a rising people, the southern provinces imitated the wealth
   and elegance of Italy. Many were the cities of Gaul, Marseilles, Arles,
   Nismes, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Bourdeaux, Autun, Vienna, Lyons, Langres, and
   Treves, whose ancient condition might sustain an equal, and perhaps
   advantageous comparison with their present state. With regard to Spain,
   that country flourished as a province, and has declined as a kingdom.
   Exhausted by the abuse of her strength, by America, and by superstition,
   her pride might possibly be confounded, if we required such a list of
   three hundred and sixty cities, as Pliny has exhibited under the reign of
   Vespasian. III. Three hundred African cities had once acknowledged the
   authority of Carthage, nor is it likely that their numbers diminished
   under the administration of the emperors: Carthage itself rose with new
   splendor from its ashes; and that capital, as well as Capua and Corinth,
   soon recovered all the advantages which can be separated from independent
   sovereignty. IV. The provinces of the East present the contrast of Roman
   magnificence with Turkish barbarism. The ruins of antiquity scattered over
   uncultivated fields, and ascribed, by ignorance, to the power of magic,
   scarcely afford a shelter to the oppressed peasant or wandering Arab.
   Under the reign of the Cæsars, the proper Asia alone contained five
   hundred populous cities, enriched with all the gifts of nature, and
   adorned with all the refinements of art. Eleven cities of Asia had once
   disputed the honor of dedicating a temple of Tiberius, and their
   respective merits were examined by the senate. Four of them were
   immediately rejected as unequal to the burden; and among these was
   Laodicea, whose splendor is still displayed in its ruins. Laodicea
   collected a very considerable revenue from its flocks of sheep, celebrated
   for the fineness of their wool, and had received, a little before the
   contest, a legacy of above four hundred thousand pounds by the testament
   of a generous citizen. If such was the poverty of Laodicea, what must have
   been the wealth of those cities, whose claim appeared preferable, and
   particularly of Pergamus, of Smyrna, and of Ephesus, who so long disputed
   with each other the titular primacy of Asia? The capitals of Syria and
   Egypt held a still superior rank in the empire; Antioch and Alexandria
   looked down with disdain on a crowd of dependent cities, and yielded, with
   reluctance, to the majesty of Rome itself.
 </p>
<p id="p2.4.1">
   All these cities were connected with each other, and with the capital, by
   the public highways, which, issuing from the Forum of Rome, traversed
   Italy, pervaded the provinces, and were terminated only by the frontiers
   of the empire. If we carefully trace the distance from the wall of
   Antoninus to Rome, and from thence to Jerusalem, it will be found that the
   great chain of communication, from the north-west to the south-east point
   of the empire, was drawn out to the length of four thousand and eighty
   Roman miles. The public roads were accurately divided by mile-stones, and
   ran in a direct line from one city to another, with very little respect
   for the obstacles either of nature or private property. Mountains were
   perforated, and bold arches thrown over the broadest and most rapid
   streams. The middle part of the road was raised into a terrace which
   commanded the adjacent country, consisted of several strata of sand,
   gravel, and cement, and was paved with large stones, or, in some places
   near the capital, with granite. Such was the solid construction of the
   Roman highways, whose firmness has not entirely yielded to the effort of
   fifteen centuries. They united the subjects of the most distant provinces
   by an easy and familiar intercourse; but their primary object had been to
   facilitate the marches of the legions; nor was any country considered as
   completely subdued, till it had been rendered, in all its parts, pervious
   to the arms and authority of the conqueror. The advantage of receiving the
   earliest intelligence, and of conveying their orders with celerity,
   induced the emperors to establish, throughout their extensive dominions,
   the regular institution of posts. Houses were everywhere erected at the
   distance only of five or six miles; each of them was constantly provided
   with forty horses, and by the help of these relays, it was easy to travel
   a hundred miles in a day along the Roman roads. * The use of posts was
   allowed to those who claimed it by an Imperial mandate; but though
   originally intended for the public service, it was sometimes indulged to
   the business or conveniency of private citizens. Nor was the communication
   of the Roman empire less free and open by sea than it was by land. The
   provinces surrounded and enclosed the Mediterranean: and Italy, in the
   shape of an immense promontory, advanced into the midst of that great
   lake. The coasts of Italy are, in general, destitute of safe harbors; but
   human industry had corrected the deficiencies of nature; and the
   artificial port of Ostia, in particular, situate at the mouth of the
   Tyber, and formed by the emperor Claudius, was a useful monument of Roman
   greatness. From this port, which was only sixteen miles from the capital,
   a favorable breeze frequently carried vessels in seven days to the columns
   of Hercules, and in nine or ten, to Alexandria in Egypt.
 </p>
<p>
   Whatever evils either reason or declamation have imputed to extensive
   empire, the power of Rome was attended with some beneficial consequences
   to mankind; and the same freedom of intercourse which extended the vices,
   diffused likewise the improvements, of social life. In the more remote
   ages of antiquity, the world was unequally divided. The East was in the
   immemorial possession of arts and luxury; whilst the West was inhabited by
   rude and warlike barbarians, who either disdained agriculture, or to whom
   it was totally unknown. Under the protection of an established government,
   the productions of happier climates, and the industry of more civilized
   nations, were gradually introduced into the western countries of Europe;
   and the natives were encouraged, by an open and profitable commerce, to
   multiply the former, as well as to improve the latter. It would be almost
   impossible to enumerate all the articles, either of the animal or the
   vegetable reign, which were successively imported into Europe from Asia
   and Egypt: but it will not be unworthy of the dignity, and much less of
   the utility, of an historical work, slightly to touch on a few of the
   principal heads. 1. Almost all the flowers, the herbs, and the fruits,
   that grow in our European gardens, are of foreign extraction, which, in
   many cases, is betrayed even by their names: the apple was a native of
   Italy, and when the Romans had tasted the richer flavor of the apricot,
   the peach, the pomegranate, the citron, and the orange, they contented
   themselves with applying to all these new fruits the common denomination
   of apple, discriminating them from each other by the additional epithet of
   their country. 2. In the time of Homer, the vine grew wild in the island
   of Sicily, and most probably in the adjacent continent; but it was not
   improved by the skill, nor did it afford a liquor grateful to the taste,
   of the savage inhabitants. A thousand years afterwards, Italy could boast,
   that of the fourscore most generous and celebrated wines, more than two
   thirds were produced from her soil. The blessing was soon communicated to
   the Narbonnese province of Gaul; but so intense was the cold to the north
   of the Cevennes, that, in the time of Strabo, it was thought impossible to
   ripen the grapes in those parts of Gaul. This difficulty, however, was
   gradually vanquished; and there is some reason to believe, that the
   vineyards of Burgundy are as old as the age of the Antonines. 3. The
   olive, in the western world, followed the progress of peace, of which it
   was considered as the symbol. Two centuries after the foundation of Rome,
   both Italy and Africa were strangers to that useful plant: it was
   naturalized in those countries; and at length carried into the heart of
   Spain and Gaul. The timid errors of the ancients, that it required a
   certain degree of heat, and could only flourish in the neighborhood of the
   sea, were insensibly exploded by industry and experience. 4. The
   cultivation of flax was transported from Egypt to Gaul, and enriched the
   whole country, however it might impoverish the particular lands on which
   it was sown. 5. The use of artificial grasses became familiar to the
   farmers both of Italy and the provinces, particularly the Lucerne, which
   derived its name and origin from Media. The assured supply of wholesome
   and plentiful food for the cattle during winter, multiplied the number of
   the docks and herds, which in their turn contributed to the fertility of
   the soil. To all these improvements may be added an assiduous attention to
   mines and fisheries, which, by employing a multitude of laborious hands,
   serve to increase the pleasures of the rich and the subsistence of the
   poor. The elegant treatise of Columella describes the advanced state of
   the Spanish husbandry under the reign of Tiberius; and it may be observed,
   that those famines, which so frequently afflicted the infant republic,
   were seldom or never experienced by the extensive empire of Rome. The
   accidental scarcity, in any single province, was immediately relieved by
   the plenty of its more fortunate neighbors.
 </p>
<p>
   Agriculture is the foundation of manufactures; since the productions of
   nature are the materials of art. Under the Roman empire, the labor of an
   industrious and ingenious people was variously, but incessantly, employed
   in the service of the rich. In their dress, their table, their houses, and
   their furniture, the favorites of fortune united every refinement of
   conveniency, of elegance, and of splendor, whatever could soothe their
   pride or gratify their sensuality. Such refinements, under the odious name
   of luxury, have been severely arraigned by the moralists of every age; and
   it might perhaps be more conducive to the virtue, as well as happiness, of
   mankind, if all possessed the necessaries, and none the superfluities, of
   life. But in the present imperfect condition of society, luxury, though it
   may proceed from vice or folly, seems to be the only means that can
   correct the unequal distribution of property. The diligent mechanic, and
   the skilful artist, who have obtained no share in the division of the
   earth, receive a voluntary tax from the possessors of land; and the latter
   are prompted, by a sense of interest, to improve those estates, with whose
   produce they may purchase additional pleasures. This operation, the
   particular effects of which are felt in every society, acted with much
   more diffusive energy in the Roman world. The provinces would soon have
   been exhausted of their wealth, if the manufactures and commerce of luxury
   had not insensibly restored to the industrious subjects the sums which
   were exacted from them by the arms and authority of Rome. As long as the
   circulation was confined within the bounds of the empire, it impressed the
   political machine with a new degree of activity, and its consequences,
   sometimes beneficial, could never become pernicious.
 </p>
<p>
   But it is no easy task to confine luxury within the limits of an empire.
   The most remote countries of the ancient world were ransacked to supply
   the pomp and delicacy of Rome. The forests of Scythia afforded some
   valuable furs. Amber was brought over land from the shores of the Baltic
   to the Danube; and the barbarians were astonished at the price which they
   received in exchange for so useless a commodity. There was a considerable
   demand for Babylonian carpets, and other manufactures of the East; but the
   most important and unpopular branch of foreign trade was carried on with
   Arabia and India. Every year, about the time of the summer solstice, a
   fleet of a hundred and twenty vessels sailed from Myos-hormos, a port of
   Egypt, on the Red Sea. By the periodical assistance of the monsoons, they
   traversed the ocean in about forty days. The coast of Malabar, or the
   island of Ceylon, was the usual term of their navigation, and it was in
   those markets that the merchants from the more remote countries of Asia
   expected their arrival. The return of the fleet of Egypt was fixed to the
   months of December or January; and as soon as their rich cargo had been
   transported on the backs of camels, from the Red Sea to the Nile, and had
   descended that river as far as Alexandria, it was poured, without delay,
   into the capital of the empire. The objects of oriental traffic were
   splendid and trifling; silk, a pound of which was esteemed not inferior in
   value to a pound of gold; precious stones, among which the pearl claimed
   the first rank after the diamond; and a variety of aromatics, that were
   consumed in religious worship and the pomp of funerals. The labor and risk
   of the voyage was rewarded with almost incredible profit; but the profit
   was made upon Roman subjects, and a few individuals were enriched at the
   expense of the public. As the natives of Arabia and India were contented
   with the productions and manufactures of their own country, silver, on the
   side of the Romans, was the principal, if not the only * instrument of
   commerce. It was a complaint worthy of the gravity of the senate, that, in
   the purchase of female ornaments, the wealth of the state was
   irrecoverably given away to foreign and hostile nations. The annual loss
   is computed, by a writer of an inquisitive but censorious temper, at
   upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds sterling. Such was the style of
   discontent, brooding over the dark prospect of approaching poverty. And
   yet, if we compare the proportion between gold and silver, as it stood in
   the time of Pliny, and as it was fixed in the reign of Constantine, we
   shall discover within that period a very considerable increase. There is
   not the least reason to suppose that gold was become more scarce; it is
   therefore evident that silver was grown more common; that whatever might
   be the amount of the Indian and Arabian exports, they were far from
   exhausting the wealth of the Roman world; and that the produce of the
   mines abundantly supplied the demands of commerce.
 </p>
<p>
   Notwithstanding the propensity of mankind to exalt the past, and to
   depreciate the present, the tranquil and prosperous state of the empire
   was warmly felt, and honestly confessed, by the provincials as well as
   Romans. “They acknowledged that the true principles of social life, laws,
   agriculture, and science, which had been first invented by the wisdom of
   Athens, were now firmly established by the power of Rome, under whose
   auspicious influence the fiercest barbarians were united by an equal
   government and common language. They affirm, that with the improvement of
   arts, the human species were visibly multiplied. They celebrate the
   increasing splendor of the cities, the beautiful face of the country,
   cultivated and adorned like an immense garden; and the long festival of
   peace which was enjoyed by so many nations, forgetful of the ancient
   animosities, and delivered from the apprehension of future danger.”
   Whatever suspicions may be suggested by the air of rhetoric and
   declamation, which seems to prevail in these passages, the substance of
   them is perfectly agreeable to historic truth.
 </p>
<p>
   It was scarcely possible that the eyes of contemporaries should discover
   in the public felicity the latent causes of decay and corruption. This
   long peace, and the uniform government of the Romans, introduced a slow
   and secret poison into the vitals of the empire. The minds of men were
   gradually reduced to the same level, the fire of genius was extinguished,
   and even the military spirit evaporated. The natives of Europe were brave
   and robust. Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum supplied the legions with
   excellent soldiers, and constituted the real strength of the monarchy.
   Their personal valor remained, but they no longer possessed that public
   courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of
   national honor, the presence of danger, and the habit of command. They
   received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign, and trusted
   for their defence to a mercenary army. The posterity of their boldest
   leaders was contented with the rank of citizens and subjects. The most
   aspiring spirits resorted to the court or standard of the emperors; and
   the deserted provinces, deprived of political strength or union,
   insensibly sunk into the languid indifference of private life.
 </p>
<p>
   The love of letters, almost inseparable from peace and refinement, was
   fashionable among the subjects of Hadrian and the Antonines, who were
   themselves men of learning and curiosity. It was diffused over the whole
   extent of their empire; the most northern tribes of Britons had acquired a
   taste for rhetoric; Homer as well as Virgil were transcribed and studied
   on the banks of the Rhine and Danube; and the most liberal rewards sought
   out the faintest glimmerings of literary merit. The sciences of physic and
   astronomy were successfully cultivated by the Greeks; the observations of
   Ptolemy and the writings of Galen are studied by those who have improved
   their discoveries and corrected their errors; but if we except the
   inimitable Lucian, this age of indolence passed away without having
   produced a single writer of original genius, or who excelled in the arts
   of elegant composition.* The authority of Plato and Aristotle, of Zeno
   and Epicurus, still reigned in the schools; and their systems, transmitted
   with blind deference from one generation of disciples to another,
   precluded every generous attempt to exercise the powers, or enlarge the
   limits, of the human mind. The beauties of the poets and orators, instead
   of kindling a fire like their own, inspired only cold and servile
   imitations: or if any ventured to deviate from those models, they deviated
   at the same time from good sense and propriety. On the revival of letters,
   the youthful vigor of the imagination, after a long repose, national
   emulation, a new religion, new languages, and a new world, called forth
   the genius of Europe. But the provincials of Rome, trained by a uniform
   artificial foreign education, were engaged in a very unequal competition
   with those bold ancients, who, by expressing their genuine feelings in
   their native tongue, had already occupied every place of honor. The name
   of Poet was almost forgotten; that of Orator was usurped by the sophists.
   A cloud of critics, of compilers, of commentators, darkened the face of
   learning, and the decline of genius was soon followed by the corruption of
   taste.
 </p>
<p>
   The sublime Longinus, who, in somewhat a later period, and in the court of
   a Syrian queen, preserved the spirit of ancient Athens, observes and
   laments this degeneracy of his contemporaries, which debased their
   sentiments, enervated their courage, and depressed their talents. “In the
   same manner,” says he, “as some children always remain pygmies, whose
   infant limbs have been too closely confined, thus our tender minds,
   fettered by the prejudices and habits of a just servitude, are unable to
   expand themselves, or to attain that well-proportioned greatness which we
   admire in the ancients; who, living under a popular government, wrote with
   the same freedom as they acted.” This diminutive stature of mankind, if we
   pursue the metaphor, was daily sinking below the old standard, and the
   Roman world was indeed peopled by a race of pygmies; when the fierce
   giants of the north broke in, and mended the puny breed. They restored a
   manly spirit of freedom; and after the revolution of ten centuries,
   freedom became the happy parent of taste and science.
